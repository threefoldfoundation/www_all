# Decentralized Developer

#### Solutions that help developers to build in a decentralized way

Software development has morphed into a distributed activity where people are scattered over the world, working together. This has been a trend for a long time (long before COVID-19 hit the world) through off-shoring (geographically distributed teams cooperating in the development of an application), component-based software development (two separate development cycles interact: development of component and development of the composite) and Software-as-a-Service (the two main stakeholders, service provider and the service client, continue to interact at run time). 

A specific tool set is required to be able to work and develop software in this manner, something for which ThreeFold has carefully researched and put a toolset together. There will be more tools added over time.

## Solutions List
