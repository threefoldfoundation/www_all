### How to Publish a Website

There are a few things to know when you want to publish a website:

- Title: Is the title shown up on your published content.
- Repository URL: is a valid git repository URL where your content lives
- Branch: is the deployment branch that exists on your git repository to be used as the version of your content to publish.

Example of a Website repository:

The folder file structure should look like this:

```
- src
    - index.html
    - css
        - somecssfile.css
    js
        - ..
    ..
```
