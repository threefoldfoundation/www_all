<!-- TODO GEERT
- intro: explain what you can monitor in terms of k8s monitoring
- intro: explain what you can do either monitoring online or locally

The health of the VDC you deploy can be monitored. A stack has been prepared that offers monitoring through Prometheus and Grafana.

The scope of Kubernetes is very large, and each of these components can be monitored: the master and worker nodes (in terms of CPU consumption, memory usage, disk space usage, ...), but also the kubelet, pods, workloads, ...

## Getting Started

> For monitoring using the stack solution on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), please read [**Monitoring Stack**](cloud__evdc_monitoring_stack.md).

> For monitoring on your local machine, please read [**Monitoring Local**](cloud__evdc_monitoring_local.md).
