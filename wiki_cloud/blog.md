### How to Publish a Blog

There are a few things you need to know when you want to publish a blog:

- Title: Is the title shown on your published content.
- Repository URL: is a valid git repository URL where your content lives.
- Branch: is the deployment branch that exists on your git repository to be used as the version of your content to publish.

Example of a Blog repository: [https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/www_tfblog](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/www_tfblog)

This name will be used to identify this blog on your 'deployed blogs list' on the [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) Admin Panel Dashboard. Keep in mind that this name would also be used as your blog's subdomain (a part of your blog's address).
