# Release notes TF Grid 2.2.0

This release introduces a major change in the way capacity is reserved on the Grid. In previous version, the deployment of workloads and the payment of capacity was done in a single step. This lead to different types of issues and a bad user experience.

As as result of this observation, a new concept has been introduced: The capacity pool. The idea behind is to decouple the reservation/payment of capacity from the provisioning of workloads. Having these 2 steps split apart enable nice new features:

* Instantaneous provisioning of workloads. Since there is no more need to wait for blockchain transaction worklaods can be deployed in seconds
* No more expiration of workloads. As long as user keeps its capacity pool filled, all attached workloads will continue to live forever
* Ability to cancel a workload without "losing" tokens used to deploy it.
* Easier capacity planning and organization of the capacity reserved

For a complete detail and rational about this new feature, head to the [specification document](https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfexplorer/blob/master/specs/modify_IT_contract_over_time.md).

## Higlights
