# Introducing: The ThreeFold Marketplace

![](cloud__tfnow_home.png  )

- **The ThreeFold Marketplace** is a collection of ready-made open-source peer-to-peer solutions that are built on top of ThreeFold Grid – the largest and most advanced peer-to-peer cloud in the world – deployable via [eVDC Admin Panel](cloud__evdc.md).
- Its main goal is to enable simplified deployment of safe, secure, and private solutions that will decentralize our lives, without the necessity of technical system administration knowledge.
- In its early stages on testnet, there are already offerings covering various fields from a peer-to-peer video sharing platform, to an online [Publishing System](threefold__publisher), to office tools, and more.

<!-- > See [__Getting Started Manual__](threefold_now_getting_started.md). -->

### Some examples:

<!-- - [__3Bot__](3bot.md): A versatile tool to administrate and control processes and activities of your solutions on top of the TF Grid. -->

- **Website**: A [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) alternative to centralized cloud-hosted websites.
- **Wiki**: An online encyclopedia accessible via an IP and a public domain.
- **Blog**: Is a [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) alternative to Tumblr or Blogspot.
- **Video Sharing**: An open-source video platform that uses peer-to-peer tech to reduce load on individual servers when viewing videos.
- **Team Collaboration**: An open source Slack-alternative messaging platform that enables secure team collaboration.
- **Git Service**: A painless self-hosted Git service.
- **Community Forum**: An open source forum built to educate members about civil community engagement.
- **Office Tools**: A fully-secured, encrypted alternative to popular office tools and cloud services.
- **Project Management**: A [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) alternative to centralized project management tool for multi-functional agile teams.

Most _live_ solutions have brief deployment tutorials on their specific pages within this wiki. And soon, all will be there!
