# How to Deploy a ZeroCI server on eVDC

[ZeroCI](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zeroCI) is ThreeFold's own continuous integration tool for developers looking to build on top of the decentralized ThreeFold Grid.

It is useful for all languages, though it has some more specific features for Python projects that generates test summary into xml file. It is integrated with version control systems and Telegram.
