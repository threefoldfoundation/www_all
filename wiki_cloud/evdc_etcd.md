# Deploy a ETCD key-value database in your eVDC

[etcd](https://etcd.io/) is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being :

- Simple: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
- Secure: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
- Fast: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
- Reliable: properly distributed using Raft

## Getting Started
