# Deploy a solution under your webdomain

A solution can be deployed under an auto-generated url or can be linked to your own domain. 

## How to link a marketplace solution to your own domain ? 

During the chatflow, the question will be asked to select a subdomain. Select the option `Choose a custom subdomain`to publish your solution to your own domain.
