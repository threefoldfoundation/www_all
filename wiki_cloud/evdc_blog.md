## Requirements

- A **github account**.
- A **public github repository** complete with folders containing your blog codes and files. [**Click here**](https://github.com/threefoldtech/blog_example) to see an example of a blog repo that you can fork (copy to your own github).
- **Optional for custom domain**: an active domain that assigns to a particular IP that will be given to you during deployment. Depending where you purchased your domain, each domain registery has its own procedure on how to assign an IP. Click [**here**](https://www.hostmysite.com/support/cpanel/dns/domain_point/) to read a general tutorial on how to assign an IP to your domain.
- An **active eVDC** with sufficient capacity.

## Get Started

Once you're logged in the eVDC, find the **Blog** marketplace widget on your admin panel and click on **Deploy** button.

Select the domain type for your blog. For deployment with random subdomain, select `Choose subdomain for me on a gateway`. For deployment with a particular available subdomain, select `Choose a custom subdomain on a gateway`. To host a blog using your own domain, select `choose a custom domain`.

- Repository url: the url address of your blog's source codes on github
- Branch: the main official working version of your project. Read more about github branch [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches)
- Source directory: the name of the main folder in your github repository where all your html codes, css, index.html page, and other codes that make up your blog pages live.

To create a blog from a template website from ThreeFold, go to [Template Website](https://github.com/threefoldtech/blog_example) on github and click on fork.
