# Release notes TF Grid 2.0.5 beta

TF Grid 2.0.5 beta is a minor release which is focus on bug fixing and stability improvement. It also include an update in the way how billing works for reservations.

We have received quite a lot of feedback from the field regarding difficulty of installation and confusion around how identity works.
These concerned have been addressed, documentation improved and 3sdk CLI tool simplified.

- Streamlined installation for normal and expert modes across all supported platforms
- Better visualization of reservations in chatflows and admin panel
- Admin panel components more defensive to help users reach successful reservations
- Customized views for solutions for easier management
- Step-by-step tutorials: a new section has been created into the manual specially for this.

The billing of the reservation has been updated. The amount of token required to make a reservation is now computed per hour. This allows to create very short living reservations. Detail of the new billing is documented in the [wiki](capacity_pricing_start?id=Threefold-grid-capacity-pricing-promotion).
