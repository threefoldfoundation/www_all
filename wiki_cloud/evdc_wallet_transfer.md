# Import eVDC Wallet to External Wallet

When you have successfully funded your eVDC Wallet with additional [TFT](threefold__threefold_token), you could also transfer this balance to another eVDC Wallet, or any other [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) wallet by importing your eVDC Wallet to external wallet. In order to do so, there are a few different wallet options you can import your eVDC Wallet to. Read more about supported wallets information on [How get and store [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) tutorial](https://manual2.threefold.io/#/mainnet_gettft).

On testnet, a [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) transfer / wallet import is recommended periodically. Since testnet is used for testing purposes, there will be times when a testnet reset is necessary to be done, thus resulting in evdc wallet, workloads, solutions and evdc accounts become deleted. Therefore, we always remind users to import their testnet eVDC Wallet to an external wallet and transfer their [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) Balance out to another wallet before the reset takes place.

**Please keep in mind that we would not be able to refund any [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) after each testnet reset is done, if you fail to import your eVDC wallet transfer the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) out of your eVDC beforehand.**

- You can transfer your [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) from eVDC mainnet or testnet, and import your wallet into a third party [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) wallet (mainnet), like Sollar Wallet or Interstellar Wallet.
- You should only import / transfer your [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) to **a mainnet [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) wallet**, regardless if it is currently on eVDC wallet testnet. Since we are only using mainnet [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) for testing purposes.

You can transfer your [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) onto a third party [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) wallet; like Sollar Wallet or Interstellar Wallet. On this tutorial, we will be transfering [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) from eVDC Wallet to **Solar Wallet (mainnet)** as an example.
