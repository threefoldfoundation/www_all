# Release notes TF Grid 2.0.4.beta

**Experts and scripters only**

- the current release is not intended for an end user audience, there is no easy to use interface
- the sdk which you could run on your computer or in the grid itself allows you to develop solutions on top of the grid.

## known issues

- 3sdk installer windows support is early beta quality level, it did not receive enough exposure yet
- documentation is not good enough yet, we will be adding lots of content over next weeks
- the 3sdk installer needs to improve (less verbose errors, more support for user edge cases, ...)
- python notebooks and visual codeserver could use a lot of memory (these are 3e party components we use and we could not resolve this)
