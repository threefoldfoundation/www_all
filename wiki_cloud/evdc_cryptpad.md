# Deploy Cryptpad in your VDC

[Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/) is a private-by-design alternative to the Office tools als offered by Microsoft and Google. 
It has most of the same crucial functionalities you would be used to with existing tools.
However, all the content stored on CryptPad is encrypted before being sent, which means nobody can access your data unless you give them the keys (not even us).
Encryption happens in the browser that is used to access the "pads" â€“ and therefore the central storage facility used does not see un-encrypted data and only sees encrypted data passing by.

### Getting Started

In the marketplace, click on the `DEPLOY` button.

Choose the size of the capacity that you want to reserve for this solution, both in terms of compute power, memory and storage capacity for your documents.
