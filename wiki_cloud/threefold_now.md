# Introducing: ThreeFold NOW Marketplace

![](cloud__tfnow_home.png  )

- **ThreeFold NOW Marketplace** is a marketplace of open source peer-to-peer solutions that are built on top of [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), deployable via [eVDC Admin Panel](cloud__evdc.md).
- Its main goal is to enable simplified deployment of safe, secure, and private solutions that will decentralize our lives, without the necessity of technical system administration knowledge.
- In its early stages on testnet, there are already offerings covering various fields from a peer-to-peer video sharing platform, to an online [Publishing System](threefold__publisher), to office tools, and more.
