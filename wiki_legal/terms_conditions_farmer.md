### 2. FARMER SERVICES

The Farmer may provide IT Capacity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) (the "**Farmer Services**") pursuant to the terms hereof during the Term of this Agreement. The Farmer Services include the features and functionality applicable to the version of the TF Operating System (Zero OS) installed by the Farmer and TF Blockchain Software (together also referred to as the “**Software**”). Company may update the content, functionality, and user interface of the Farmer Services from time to time in its sole discretion.

By entering into this Agreement you receive a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to provide the Farmer Services pursuant to this Agreement during the Term hereof solely for your internal business purposes subject to the limitations set forth herein.

The Software consists of open source code and is made available to you pursuant to the terms of the open-source license agreement(s) as located on https://github.com/threefoldtech and https://github.com/threefoldfoundation (the "**Open Source License(s)**"). Your use of the Software or any other Content (Information) is conditioned upon your compliance at all times with the terms of all applicable Open Source License(s). [Example license for Zero-OS can be found here](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos/blob/master/LICENCE).

Including without limitation all provisions governing access to source code, modification, and/or reverse engineering. You are responsible for complying with any applicable documentation, meaning any information that describes the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), provides instructions or recommendations related to the configuration and/or use of the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), or otherwise informs Users of the intended use of the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), including, but not limited to content provided directly to User or published at [https://wiki.threefold.io](https://wiki.threefold.io), [https://manual.threefold.io](https://manual.threefold.io), [https://forum.threefold.io](https://forum.threefold.io) or otherwise made available in conjunction with the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) or the Software (“**Documentation**”) and for satisfying all technical requirements of the Software, including any requirements set forth in the Documentation for ensuring that the Software performs properly.
### 3. FARMER GRANT OF RIGHT TO IT CAPACITY

By making available one or more computers, network or storage devices ("**[3Node](threefold__3node)s**") and connecting such [3Node](threefold__3node)s to the TF Grid (as part of a Farming Pool) via the Software, you hereby grant to Company and Users the irrevocable right to access and use the [3Node](threefold__3node)s as follows:

- to use storage, compute and network services as delivered by your [3Node](threefold__3node)(s)
- to store data and materials by Users on your [3Node](threefold__3node)(s) (the "**Content**") and to access such Content from your [3Node](threefold__3node)(s) at any time

in accordance with the capabilities of the software installed on the [3Node](threefold__3node)s;
### 4. CERTIFIED VS. DIY-FARMERS

There are two types of ThreeFold Farmers:

1. Certified Farmer: Uses hardware from certified sources and signs a contract with TF Tech NV for support and additional benefits
2. Do It Yourself (DIY) Farmer: Uses any hardware and in case of support uses online material only.

Farmers can opt in for certification ("**Certification**"). Certification can be withdrawn in case the relevant [3Node](threefold__3node) does no longer comply with the applicable certification requirements.

The following criteria or requirements are checked (timing of implementation, see roadmap on wiki):

- Bandwidth: 24 times a day random non local nodes are used to upload a 2MB file to a [3Node](threefold__3node). The bandwidth will be measured in mbit/sec
- Utilization: Through the ThreeFold Explorer the true utilization of the [3Node](threefold__3node) will be checked. It will be displayed in % of the [3Node](threefold__3node) total capacity.
- Uptime: The uptime per month will be created in the ThreeFold Explorer and is presented as a percentage of [3Node](threefold__3node) availability.

ThreeFold Foundation or [ThreeFold Tech](threefold__threefold_tech) may give free certification to [3Node](threefold__3node)s that benefit the distribution of capacity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

ThreeFold Foundation or [ThreeFold Tech](threefold__threefold_tech) may also certify certain hardware partners (i.e. certified hardware vendors) as part of this certification process.
### 5. FARMER RESPONSIBILITIES

At all times during the Term of this Agreement or the period when Content is maintained in your [3Node](threefold__3node), whichever is longer:

1. You will comply with the terms of this Agreement, the [Generic Disclaimer](legal__disclaimer.md), [ThreeFold Website Terms](legal__terms_conditions_websites.md) and [Privacy Policy](legal__privacypolicy.md) and any other terms and conditions required by in connection herewith, the Open Source Licenses, and the terms of all other agreements to which you are a party in connection with your performance under this Agreement including, without limitation, any agreement you have with a third-party Internet service provider.

### 8. TFT Minting (Token Creation ‘FARMING of capacity’)

#### 8.1 General Principle

Farmers who connect [3Node](threefold__3node)s on an ongoing basis to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) by running the Software and making IT Capacity available to the Users, get rewarded by receiving [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s ([TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s) which are generated by the Software. [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s are exclusively issued (created) by the TF Chain for each active Capacity Pool which gets and remains connected to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). Such issuance of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s that results from connecting a [3Node](threefold__3node) to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) and making IT Capacity available on a global scale to Users is called "**Farming**".

#### 8.2 Calculation of Farmed TFTs

The details of farming (minting of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)’s) are described on our [farming_logic threefold: faming_logic](farming_logic) and this location serves as master for the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) minting process. The wiki is version controlled (on github), so all changes can be followed.All connected IT Capacity gets registered on the TF Chain, i.e. ThreeFolds blockchain software. Each month the TF Chain issues new [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s and transfers them to Farmers in respect of each [3Node](threefold__3node) that remained connected to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) during the preceding month, using the following calculation in respect of each [3Node](threefold__3node):

![farmer_tcs_minting_equation](legal__farmer_tcs_minting_equation.png  )

The concepts of [CPR](threefold__cloud_production_rate), [CPR](threefold__cloud_production_rate) Price and Difficulty Level are determined in the aforementioned wiki and are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

The amount of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s that are Farmed hence depends on three variables:

_1. Proof-of-Capacity_

The specs of the Farmer’s relevant [3Node](threefold__3node):

- Compute Capacity (CPU) = CRU
- Memory Capacity (RAM) = MRU
- Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD) = SRU/HRU

The performance/capability of this hardware is attributed with Cloud Units that then summarized to a Cloud Production Rate ([CPR](threefold__cloud_production_rate)) (as further described in the abovementioned wiki) for the relevant [3Node](threefold__3node). The higher the [CPR](threefold__cloud_production_rate), the more [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s are Farmed.

_2. Difficulty Level_

The amount of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s ([TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s) that Farmers receive for Farming also depends on the amount of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s that are already in circulation. The more [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s already exist, the lower the rewards. This follows the principle of diminishing returns. We call this Farming limitation to reward the "**Difficulty Level**".

When the amount of existing [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) nears 4 billion, the amount of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s received by Farmers will decrease progressively. Once the aggregate amount of "Farmed" [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s reaches four billion [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s (4,000,000,000 [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s), there won’t be any rewards for Farming anymore and no new [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s will be generated by the Software.

The Difficulty Level is the same for all Farmers at a certain point in time.

_3. Certification_

When connecting reliable hardware the Farmer can request a certification from TF Tech NV which leads to increased earnings in [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) for such ‘Certified Farmers’. We automatically measure uptime, bandwidth and the utilization of the node for this certification. The details of this certification have to be further defined and will be set out on our wiki.

#### 8.3 Uptime

In addition thereto, the Company will determine in its sole discretion the reasonable uptime that each [3Node](threefold__3node) of the Farmer needs to to achieve when they register their [3Node](threefold__3node)(s) in the TF Chain. ThreeFold expects most [3Node](threefold__3node)s to achieve an uptime of more than 98%, commercial providers can go as high as 99.9%. The TF Chain will only issue [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s if the IT Capacity was connected to the internet and was usable during the last month at least up to the specified uptime guarantee.

#### 8.4 Taxes

You will be solely responsible for payment of all applicable taxes (if any) associated with your Farming of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s (TFTA, TFT), including but not limited to value added taxes, taxes on gross receipts and income, Social Security taxes, business license fees and other payment obligations applicable to your business.

#### 8.5 Modification

The Company reserves the right to modify the terms of this section 8 (‘_Capacity Measurement and Minting - ‘Farming’_) at any time, including but not limited to the determination of the Difficulty Level. Such amendments will be subject to the approval of a majority of the members of the Company’s ‘Grid Counsel’ and a majority of the Farmers (whereby majority is measured based on nr of 3Nodes a Farmer has, each 3Node entitles the Farmer to one vote, Farmers who do not vote have no say in the decision process) who participate in an online poll organized by the Company In case of modification to these terms, the Company shall inform the Farmer at least one month in advance. In case the Farmer would not agree to such modifications, the Farmer shall have the right to immediately and unilaterally terminate this Agreement by disconnecting the Farming Pool from the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).
### 9. CAPACITY SALES (‘CULTIVATION’)

#### 9.1 General Principles

Users (such as developers or other persons requiring IT Capacity) can rent IT Capacity from the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) in exchange for [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s (TFTs), which creates a natural economic demand. We call this process of selling IT Capacity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) "**Cultivation**".

[TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s (TFTs) are used to buy or sell IT Capacity as delivered by the Capacity Pools on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). In order to do so, the Farmer shall sell the IT Capacity produced on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) via the "**ThreeFold Directory**" (or “TF Directory”). The TF Directory acts like a ‘marketplace’ for selling IT Capacity generated by the Farmer’s [3Node](threefold__3node)s. The TF Directory has been implmented by a tool called TF Explorer see http://explorer.grid.tf

In order to access the TF Directory and sell IT Capacity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), the TF Grid user or Solution Provider offering services on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) must deploy a virtual system administrator, called the "**3Bot**". This [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) is used, amongst others, to sell and buy IT Capacity (raw storage and compute resources) on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

The reservation and use of the Farmer’s IT Capacity by the User is effected through "Smart Contracts for IT". The Smart Contract for IT will then be executed automatically by the software code and the requested IT workload will be deployed. The TF Explorer calculates the required [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) Token price and makes sure that the TF Farmer receives their cultivated tokens.

#### 9.2 Cultivation Mechanism

IT capacity is expressed in compute & storage units.

- CU = [Compute Units](threefold__cloud_units.md)
- SU = [Storage Units](threefold__cloud_units.md)

The pricing is expressed as follows:

- CP = Compute Unit price - expressed in USD
- SP = Storage Unit price - expressed in USD

- T = Token price in USD at time of capacity reservation

Certified Farmers are free to determine the pricing of their IT Capacity. DIY (Do It Yourself) farmers have to rely on the TF Foundation to set the price of the CU and SU.
TF Foundation will do this with all best intentions in mind.

The IT capacity is sold through the TF Explorer using the smart contract for IT concept. TF Explorer is the inventory of all IT capacity available for consumption on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). See http://explorer.grid.tf/

Each farmer needs to register their [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) wallet in the TF Explorer and the certified farmers can register the price for the CU/SU on the TF Exlorer as well by using their farming [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def).

> Cultivation in [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) = (CU _ CP + SU _ SP) / T \* 0.9

Cultivation in [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) are the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) (Tokens) the Farmer receives when capacity has been sold as result of provisioning the IT workload by means of the IT smart contract concept.

As a result of executing the IT smart contract, 90% of the proceeds (in TFT) of the capacity sold is send to the wallet of the Farmer, 10% is send to the TF Foundation Wallet, this is an automatic action.

#### 9.3 TF Foundation Fee and License Fees TFTech

The Company (the "**Foundation Fee**") receives 10% of sales done of Cloud Units on the TF Explorer (as described above). The Company will use the revenues from the Foundation Fees to fund its projects and objectives, including, amongst others, to promote, maintain and expand the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). The Company might also decide to burn part of those tokens (TFT) to lower the total amount of tokens in the field (burning means, destroy tokens).

In case the Farmer chooses to purchase a license from TF Tech NV in order to qualify as a Certified Farmer and provide Certified Capacity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), the Farmer shall pay the relevant fee (as agreed between the Farmer and TF Tech NV directly) to TF Tech NV (the "**Certification License Fee**").

#### 9.4 Taxes

You (The Farmer) will be responsible for payment of all applicable taxes (if any) associated with your Cultivation of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s (i.e. sale of IT Capacity), including but not limited to value added taxes, sales taxes, custom taxes, and taxes on gross receipts and income.

The Farmer shall seek all necessary tax advice in order to comply with any applicable tax regulations when providing IT Capacity to Users on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). By way of example, the Farmer acknowledges that within the European Union, as from 1 January 2015, telecommunications, broadcasting and electronically supplied services are always taxed in the country of the customer (i.e. the tax residence of the User) – regardless of whether the User is a business or a consumer.

In view thereof, the Farmer will determine the applicable Farmer’s Compute Unit Price and Storage unit Price (as referred to in section 9.2 above) taking into account any aforementioned taxes that may apply. ThreeFold will not be held liable for the Farmer’s failure to comply with its legal obligations, including but not limited to its obligation to pay any applicable taxes, and the Farmer will indemnify and hold harmless the Company for claims against the Company from any tax authorities in respect of such non-compliance by the Farmer.

#### 9.5 Modification

The Company reserves the right to modify the terms of this section 9 (‘_Capacity Sales - ‘Cultivation’_’) at any time, including but not limited to the determination of the Foundation Fee. In case of modification to these terms, the Company shall inform the Farmer at least one month in advance. In case the Farmer would not agree to such modifications, the Farmer shall have the right to immediately and unilaterally terminate this Agreement by disconnecting the Farming Pool from the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

#### 9.6 Breach

In addition to its other rights and remedies under this Agreement, the Farmer forfeit any right to compensation under this Agreement if Farmer breaches any terms thereof.
### 10. TERM AND TERMINATION

This Agreement shall be effective as of the date that you take the earliest of the following actions: your acceptance of this Agreement, either by clicking to signify acceptance, or by taking any one or more of the following actions: downloading, installing, running and/or using the Software. It will continue until terminated per the terms below.

Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately at any time without notice to the other party.

In case of termination, the Farmer shall immediately cease using the Software. Any portion of Farmed or Cultivated [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s that have not been transferred to the Farmer’s wallet on the date of termination will be irrevocably forfeited.
### 11. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

No rights are granted to the Farmer hereunder other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Except for Software subject to the Open Source Licenses, and except for any rights expressly granted under this Agreement, Company and its licensors own and shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) and all related software (including any improvements, enhancements, customizations, and modifications thereto), the Documentation, and the Related Data, including, without limitation, all related intellectual property rights therein. For purposes hereof, the term "**Related Data**" means data derived from operation of the [3Node](threefold__3node) and of the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) via the [3Node](threefold__3node), and any data that is aggregated by Company (including aggregations with data sourced from other Farmers and other third party data sources), and data and information regarding the Farmer’s access to and participation in the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), including, without limitation, statistical usage data derived from the operation of the [3Node](threefold__3node) and [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) and configurations, log data and the performance results related thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting Company from utilizing Related Data to optimize and improve the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) or otherwise operate Company’s business; provided that if Company provides Related Data to third parties, such Related Data shall be de-identified and presented in the aggregate so that it will not disclose the identity of Farmers to any third party.

The [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) may include access to various confidential and proprietary third party data that is utilized along with the IT Capacity, and all such data is owned by the applicable third party source or vendor. Farmer may only use such data as part of the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) and may not extract or otherwise utilize any such data except as included in and in connection with the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). This data may be compiled from third party sources, including but not limited to, public records, user submissions, and other commercially available data sources.

Company shall have no obligation to use Feedback, and Farmer shall have no obligation to provide Feedback.
### 12. INDEMNIFICATION

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Company and our respective past, present, and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns (the "**Indemnified Parties**") from and against all claims, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that arise from or relate to: (i) your use of the Software; (ii) your participation in the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid); (iii) any Feedback you provide; or (iv) your breach of this Agreement.

Company reserves the right to exercise sole control over the defense of any claim subject to indemnification under the paragraph above, at your expense. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and Company.

If the Software becomes, or in Company’s reasonable judgment is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then Company may in its sole discretion: (a) obtain the right, for Farmer to continue using the Software; (b) provide a non-infringing functionally equivalent replacement; or (c) modify the Software so that it is no longer infringing. If Company, in its sole and reasonable judgment, determines that none of the above options are commercially reasonable, then Company may, without liability, suspend or terminate Farmer’s use of the Software. This Section 12 states Company’s sole liability and Farmer’s exclusive remedy for infringement claims.
### 13. DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

The Farmer hereby acknowledges the fact that he/she has been advised that [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s may qualify as a security and that the offers and sales of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s have not been registered under any country’s securities laws and, therefore, cannot be resold except in compliance with the applicable country’s laws.

The Farmer understands that the use of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s, the Software and/or the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) involves risks, all of which the Farmer fully and completely assumes, including, but not limited to, the risk that (i) the technology associated with the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), [3Node](threefold__3node) and/or related Threefold products will not function as intended; (ii) the Threefold project will not be completed; (iii) Threefold will fail to attract sufficient interest from key stakeholders; and (iv) ThreeFold or any related parties may be subject to investigation and punitive actions from governmental authorities.

Except as explicitly set forth herein, Company makes no representations that the Software is appropriate for use in any jurisdictions.
