ThreeFold co-founder Kristof de Spiegeleer had the opportunity and pleasure to join a panel hosted by HPE and Forum Europe on Building a European Data Infrastructure.

*About the Event:*

*Join representatives of the EU institutions, member states, businesses and other experts for a discussion on the roadmap to build a successful European Cloud Federation. As Germany and France present GAIA-X – a proposal for a decentralised cloud infrastructure – and as the European Commission prepares the follow-up to its Data Strategy, Forum Europe & HPE are pleased to host this discussion on the policies, business models and investments needed to design the blueprint for Europe’s future data economy infrastructure. The discussion will also analyse critical aspects of the project such as European data monetisation and data ownership.*
