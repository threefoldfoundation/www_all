# Digital Twin

Digital Twin is a primary use case on top of the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

Digital Twin is you as autonomous digital being on the grid which gives back the ownership of your data to only you â€“ and no one else.

Digital Twin is a response to today's reality, your escape from the many popular centralized and often-abused applications used by a big majority of the planet. It grants you full access to a 100% neutral and decentralized digital life.

Eventually other experience providers will provide experiences on top of the Digital Twin e.g. the Crystal Twin (see alliance for conscious internet and TDE)

First implementation of Digital Twin (march 2021) has following features

- filemanager (manage all your files, photos, ...)
- office documents & collaboration
- video & audio conferencing tool
- chat tool (full peer2peer)
- web and wiki publishing tool
- [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) secure networking layer
