- They check validity of code upgrades of the validator node.
- This is a more technical responsibility compared to the [Wisdom Council](threefold__wisdom_council)

This blockchain is a very important part of our ecosystem, it takes care of minting (farming proceeds), [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) vesting pools, pricing oracle, reputation engine, ...
