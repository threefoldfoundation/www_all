# Decentralisation and immutability
 

The two characteristics that have spawned interest in blockchain technology are decentralisation and immutability.  In the current world centralisation is everywhere, in most industries, governments, education systems and more and more also in the world wide web (internet) as we know it.  All roads these days seem to lead to centralised setups.

Examples of centralised setups today:

*   **Monetary**: Fiat currencies are governed and controlled by central banks.  According to wikipedia: “A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages a state's currency, money supply, and interest rates. Central banks also oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the monetary base in the state, and also prints the national currency, which serves as the state's legal tender. Central banks also act as a "lender of last resort" to the banking sector during times of financial crisis. Most central banks also have supervisory and regulatory powers to ensure the solvency of member institutions, prevent bank runs, and prevent reckless or fraudulent behavior by member banks.”.   \
 \
So central banks control fiat currencies and very little other institutions control central banks. 
*   **World Wide Web (WWW)**: The world wide web is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. Although distributed and _not_ centralised by design this technology shares and exposes information globally developed centralised functions that are crucial today to make this world wide web work: large (commercial) monopolies have developed centralised search facilities eg. yellow pages of the world wide web.  These search facilities now control what you find when you are looking for a specific search term.

So there seems to be a natural “desire” to organise and create different things with central control.  This might come from us human beings having develop social models that are based on leadership and hierarchies.  These social models have influenced a lot of what we have build in the industrial and information revolution - creating centralisation as the defacto standard of building anything. 

Now that we have invented a technology that potentially can build different things without a lot of centralisation we need to be careful to use it for the right things.
