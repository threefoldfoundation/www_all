# Crystal Home

*The Crystal Home* is bringing a different approach to housing building circular and fully self-sufficient homes that make housing construction affordable and sustainable without compromising on quality.

### Purpose

We use the city as our source where all our materials are carefully harvested and refurbished to new standards by our partner-companies, such as [New Horizon](https://newhorizon.nl/) and [Casper de Haan](https://caspardehaan.nl), ready for a second life.
The linear “take, make, waste” economic model is reaching its limits. The environment simply does not have the capacity to sustain it anymore. A circular approach creates an economy that’s both sustainable and profitable.
Our goal is to build circular & self-sufficient homes reducing the CO2 footprint and the waste flow of the construction industry.
