# Awareness Campaign June-July 2020

## Purpose

- [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) sales for funding [Token Distribution Event = TDE](threefold__tdeoverview.md)
- Farming: 10.000 new nodes on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

> It's time to find funding for the ThreeFold project <BR>
> It's time to mobilize our communities (ambassadors, alliance for conscious internet, ...) <BR>
> It's time to startup our Farmer Programs again.
> **It's NOT time for finding liquidity for our farmers or early [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) buyers**

## Status

- [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) = the network of capacity
  - [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) 2.0 is live
  - [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) 2.1 will be delivered in June/July (see [roadmap](threefold__roadmap.md))

- TFT2.0 has been released on [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain), BTCAlpha & Liquid

> Do not expect lots of liquidity to happen in next months, we expect organic growth. <BR>
> We do not hype for crypto gamblers on exchanges, we hope they will not use us for speculation purposes. <BR>

## Plan

Organic growth of our project.

### BlockChain, P2P & SAAS Projects

- Missing Layer For Blockchain, [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) & SAAS projects
- Purpose
  - Support our project, tell their community about us
  - Drive usage: use capacity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid)
- Examples
  - Blockchain: harmony, tomochain, ...
  - SaaS: icewarp, ...
  - [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer): Ankr, IPFS, HyperDrive, ...
- Details are on wiki page
- PR: through existing blockchain/P2P channels (we have partners/friends helping us)
- Expectations
  - Its organic growth, don't expect this to use all our capacity < 12 months
- THIS IS THE ONLY APPROACH WE MAKE PR ABOUT BETWEEN JUNE 1 & JUNE 15
- Centralized demo market place (launch mid June)
  -Login on centralized TF Grid Demo (with 3Bot Connect)
  - Deploy through a wizard the demo workloads (max nr of times per 3Bot Connect)
  - We get report from who did it, runs 7 days and only small capacity (is demo only)

### Farming

- 10.000 nodes in the field in 2020
- Requirements
  - As distributed as possible
  - Good connection to internet
  - Certified hardware (so at least security of the hardware)
  - Needs to be made all very simple, how to buy (through TFT)
- How
  - Collect interested parties: now (more visible on website) = form
  - Some big projects will drive faster adoption
  - Sell boxes through Dubai & Belgium (phase more partners e.g. in US): there is some margin in there for Foundation
  - Need easy web based simulator (hardware boxes have defined CU/SU -> need to show possible return visualization)
  - Make sure people understand we deliver per 100 boxes (in batches)
- Timing: launch June 15 (Monday)
