## Our 6 Point Smart IT Program

Our aim is to make your IT platform a "profit" center rather than a “cost” center. For this we believe a decentralized IT solution is the best way. IT technology providers have created technologies that are hard to install, manage, operate, and upgrade, which creates a necessity for experts to be trained, involved in, and constantly administering and supporting your IT infrastructure. Unless this dynamic is addressed, IT will always remain a cost center to your business. 

We intend to shift this dynamic and change the status quo through our **Autonomous IT** approach, an approach where your applications and digital workloads are able to install, maintain, and operate themselves, independently. 

The following 6 point program intends to improve your IT environment.

### Be more cost-effective (at least 2x better)

Our **Autonomous IT****_ _**system delivers IT that is self-driving and self-healing. This system requires a lot less hardware and has no dependency on any third-party software vendors. This system can reduce your annual expenditure on IT by at least 2X.

### Be more sustainable (at least 3x better)

Our **Autonomous IT **system delivers IT that is far more sustainable. We offer improved sustainability by:

* Using upto 3x less hardware for the same output. 

* Using hardware at least 2x longer while maintaining good performance..

* Having capacity everywhere, local to where the users are: this reduces network requirements and can even improve security;

* Using new algorithms (e.g. for blockchain and storage) which have dramatic efficiency improvement;

* Re-using hardware where possible – let's not throw away.

For storage we are 10x more "green." For blockchain workloads we can be up to 50x more sustainable.

### Be more secure (at least 10x better)

Hacking has become a part of life and is almost impossible to avoid in the current IT systems. The current IT systems are too complex and require too many people to operate. This results in less security which results in lots of security breaches. 

Most governments do not even know how often they have been hacked and it is a fact that a lot of backdoors are in their systems already today, simply waiting to be used by hacking groups. The only way to really address this security challenge is by making an IT system that is truly autonomous and with considerably fewer lines of code and significantly fewer components. The fewer components there are and the fewer people required to keep a system up and running, the safer it will be.

### Be in control 

Every large organization today is very dependant on many IT providers for the IT systems they require. These systems are often very expensive and complex to operate, and expensive maintenance programs are often required. Many of these systems have been designed to lock in their customers as much as possible and in no way encompass open standards. 

What if there were an IT system where:

* Every software component were understood and 100% owned by local teams (up to code level), and could be maintained & improved by local teams?

* Source code were available for these local teams? Where there was nothing closed source and no modules were used which were not fully understood and audited?

* These local teams would build out advanced IT expert knowledge for the country and many positive spin-offs could have a good impact on economic growth?

* The user were in total control – every user owned his or her own data – this, without losing the requirement for a government to make sure that no malintent were at stake and data could be audited?

### Be the future

We want this system to be 100% future-proof. It is not our intention to copy what is already available in the IT industry today. The goal is to leapfrog the industry with a system that is able to support the applications and workloads of the future.

No more complex upgrades or re-installs. The system is dynamic and constantly adapts in line with future requirements.

### Be complete, avoid complex integration efforts

A government does not want to have to deal with 100+ systems and large teams of consultants required to integrate these systems. There is frankly no reason why current systems are so extremely complex. Our decentralized [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) system does not need integration – it is integrated by design, no other glueing systems are needed.
