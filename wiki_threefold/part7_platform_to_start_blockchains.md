## A platform for people to start blockchains 

What if there would be a platform where the strong points of blockchains (decentralisation) can be used as a given to enable people to organise themselves around a random initiative and launch it based on blockchain technology?  Blockchain As a Service (BAAS).

 

A platform like that could be really powerful to enable people around the world to use and benefit from blockchain technology to organise themselves around digital initiatives, currencies, finance, trade, company, anything. Letâ€™s consider a small example:

60 people want to start an organisation in which they all have an equal stake.  They can organise this by going to the notary and establishing  a company that has equity and divide the equity amongst them. They can then run quarterly /annual meetings to govern and control the company. For this to work they need to have some form of administration to record all the decisions and communicate this to the rest of the organisation.

 

What if there is a platform on which they can launch a number of blockchain nodes (60, one for each of them)  in which all decisions are recorded, where all is trackable and traceable for anyone? Blockchain As A Service (BAAS) will enable people to organise themselves independently, create new movements, companies, groups, tribes - anything. This would be a really powerful platform allowing many people (and hopefully all people) to organise themselves in new ways free of the need to have notaries, lawyers and contracts.

However is order to build such a platform it needs to comply with some pretty specific requirements.  Requirements that enable such a platform not to be governed and controlled by a single organisation.  The requirements for such a platform would sum up as follows:



*   The platform cannot be owned by a single organisation, it needs to be owned by many
*   Such a platform cannot have administrator access.  Administrators access takes away the neutrality and privacy that such a platform requires.
*   The platform needs to be very efficient.  If such a platform is to be made available to all people globally it needs to be affordable by anyone
*   The platform needs to be everywhere.  Part of the efficiency is that it should to require expensive international access lines - it needs to be able to live everywhere - in well connected (and affordable) areas as well as in less well connected places.

Such a platform is a very different platform than most of what we know today.  It needs to be a platform build by many people, for anyone.  It needs to not be governed by a single organisation, it needs to be governed by many.

People with the right intentions need to be invited to get together and build such a platform based on hardware owned by many and software that is open and can be inspected and improved by anyone. In the end it is a platform build by people for people using blockchain technology to achieve a true decentralised nature of the platform running blockchain as a service.  

IT is People that provide trust, not blockchains. But blockchains help to register that trust forever.
