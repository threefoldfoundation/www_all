# ThreeFold Farming

> Farming = Produce [Cloud Capacity](threefold__ic_internet_capacity) on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

The [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) is created/expanded by ThreeFold farmers - individuals or businesses who connect compute and storage hardware (also known as servers) called [3Node](threefold__3node)s to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). 

The compute and storage capacity of [3Node](threefold__3node)s result in the release of [ThreeFold Tokens](threefold__token_what.md) for the Farmer as a reward. 

Once the farmerâ€™s capacity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) gets bought by a user he gets [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s. 

This is called [cultivation](threefold__cultivation.md).

## Types of ThreeFold Farmers

- Do It Yourself (DIY) Farmer: the default, there is no contractual relationship with anyone in the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) ecosystem, any person can become a farmer. Over time the farmer builds up reputation, measured by the Grid [Reputation Engine](threefold__reputation_engine). [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) users can consult this reputation level.
- [Certified Farming](threefold__certified_farming.md): need to comply to stronger levels of SLA (Service Level Agreements). [ThreeFold Tech](threefold__threefold_tech) will make sure that these environments are supported and documented in line with reality (e.g. location, capabilities, ...).

## remarks

- 10% of farming proceeds go to the [benefits of the ecosystem](threefold__tfgrid_fee.md).

## Farmers need to buy or build a 3Node

A [3Node](threefold__3node) is in its essence a server that is installed with [Zero-OS](threefold__zos).

The formfactor, size, and hardware specs can vary from very large (datacenter nodes) to very small (no bigger than a modern modem).

The hardware specifications of a [3Node](threefold__3node) are one of the factors that determine the amount of ThreeFold Tokens the device will farm.


## Plug & Farm

All small nodes that ThreeFold partners like [BetterToken](threefold__bettertoken) ship to its customers are what we call 'plug & farm'.  

PLug & farm means the node has already been installed and configured to farm for the customer.

There are just 2 very simple steps the customer needs to take.

1. Plug the node into power outlet
2. Provide the node with internet access

The node will be recognized by the ThreeFold Grid and get listed as available capacity.
As long as the [3Node](threefold__3node) stays online the [3Node](threefold__3node) will farm tokens.
