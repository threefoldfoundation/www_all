# Project: Crystal Language

![](https://www.consciousinternet.org/threefold/info/projects/crystal_language/crystal_language.png)

*The Crystal Language* is a programming language with the following goals:

- Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
- Be statically type-checked, but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments
- Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal
- Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code
- Compile to efficient native code

Crystal language, a language for humans and computers, born & raised at [ManasTech](https://manas.tech/).
The ThreeFold Foundation and Manas have a similar attitude towards how to make IT better.

### Purpose

The goal is to adopt the Crystal language as the default language for the development of our 2nd generation [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) core server.
This is a strategic choice and will allow us to have even less memory and CPU footprint when running the [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s.

### Funding

- Funding needed for next milestones as described below: 4,000,000 [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)

### Milestones

We are in conversations with the Crystal community and our [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) development team to fine tune the milestones. See suggestions:
