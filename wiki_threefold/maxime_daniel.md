# Maxime Daniel - @maxux

I have had a passion for programming ever since I was 10 years old. I love building something that helps
me or people to achieve goals easier, faster, and more accessible. My contribution to ThreeFold
is, in my opinion, completely in line with my passion and what I try to achieve daily, but in a large scale:
Make the world better by writing software to help people and the planet.

I like haveing the choic to do what I think is right and control my own life, and not let my life be controlled by others. I think
privacy and equity is important to everyone and fair.

By contributing to [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) and side projects, like 0-db, 0-flist, 0-initramfs, ... I think lot of my life goals
are achieved in a right way.
