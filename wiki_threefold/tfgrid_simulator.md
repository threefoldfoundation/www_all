# TFGrid Simulator:

The simulator allows you to explore how the value of the grid goes up in relation to the size of the network and the token price.

Find the [simulator here](https://secure.threefold.me/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/aVb6Vl371xL0dumfgnLvVuaAyU7v3XPinJvFXXjbj5E/)

## TFGrid Growth

![](threefold__gridsimulation_token_growth.png  ':size=500x')

- Growth: is in nr of nodes which we expect the grid to have in 5 years
  - 1% market share of current internet cloud is about 5-10.000.000 servers.
  - In this example we simulate 1000k servers over 5 years.

## avg node assumptions

To see more details about simulation for a specific type of node see the [farming simulator](threefold__tffarming_simulator.md)

## token modelling assumptions

![](threefold__tfgridsimulator_3.png  ':size=700x')


You can put in the token price you expect and then compare with the value the grid will have.

This can tell you if your assumptions were the right ones.

## cultivation assumptions

Unit Price Range: these are the sales prices of the cloud units, this param allows you to choose the avg price range the grid will sell it capacity for (see here for pricing info about the cloud)

- CU = compute unit, 15 USD is a good price (on market between 20 and 200)
- SU = storage unit, 10 USD is a good price (on market between 20 and 160)
- NU = network unit

The simulator only takes capacity sales into consideration, the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) will be used for many other use cases but this has not been included in the simulator. 

The simulator is just a way to visualize the growth of the grid in relation to [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) price and how the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) provides a good economical model for the TF Farmer.

## Valuation Excercise

![](threefold__tfgrid_simulation_result.png  ':size=700x')

For hosting (cloud) business valuation is typically calculated based on recurring revenue or net margin.

- It can easily go upto 10 times in recurring yearly margin, here we chose 5 times.
- It can go upto 5-6 times in recurring yearly revenue

Multiples are that high because of its recurring revenue.

> If an acquirer would buy at 10 times recurring margin and there would be 0% growth (which is not realistic), it would mean that the acquirer would have all money back in 10 years of the acquisition cost.

## Conclusion of this example

Please do your own simulation but if these parameters would be correct it shows how the value of the grid would be way higher than the marketcap of the tokens.

> This is at a token price of 2USD which is way higher than today, this shows our sound tokenomics model behind the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token).

## Disclaimer

> Important note: The ThreeFold Token (TFT) is not an investment instrument. <BR>
> [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s are used to buy and sell IT capacity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).
