#### Collaborations

We announced partnerships in the blockchain space with:

- [SelfKey](https://selfkey.org/threefold-partners-with-selfkey/)
- [TomoChain](https://blog.threefold.io/blog/tfblog/posts/tomochain--threefold-joining-forces-to-decentralize-cloud-computing---tomochain-masternodes)
- [DigiByte](https://bit.ly/digibytethreefold)
- [WaykiChain](https://bit.ly/waykithreefold)
- and [Harmony](https://bit.ly/harmonythreefold)!

While these partnerships are in their early stages and will differ in some ways, bringing true decentralization through the use of [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) is a commonality for all.

#### In The News

Our co-founder Kristof [sat down with Ivan on Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSZbF7eOp_s&feature=youtu.be) to discuss ThreeFold for his audience of blockchain and tech enthusiasts.

It's about 20 minutes long. Enjoy, and please share!
