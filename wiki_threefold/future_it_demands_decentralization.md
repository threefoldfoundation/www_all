### Future IT Workloads Demand Decentralization

The current digital world is built around centralized infrastructure and datastores. We have been educated to store value in central places as that allows for "perimeter" security similar to how we secured money in large bank vaults.  However, the world has changed and storing everything in central locations is no longer viable, as it causes massive data replication.

We need to move to a model where the data stays close to where it is created and is not moved to central storage locations that enable remote access. The traditional model has allowed us to innovate and control costs over the last two decades but will not fuel/allow for innovation in the next decade.

For innovation to excel going forward, we need to decentralize the compute and storage model to allow an exponential increase in data generation to happen, while retaining the reliability of data, and making sure that the security model around all of this data is good enough to keep out the bad people.  

Also, with the exponential growth of data creation, we need to be much more aware of the effectiveness and sustainability of the compute and storage model. 

These points are illustrated in the infographic below.

The current centralized infrastructure cannot deliver on the required items to support the exponential growth of compute and storage requirements.

For reliability of such infrastructure, the current model of deploying infrastructure and applications is too complex. Many people are required to build simple setups and it is very easy to make mistakes leading to a lower-than-required reliable setup. Same thing for security – it is mind-bogglingly complex to manage a four football field sized datacenter and all its technology

#### Is Blockchain up to the Challenge ?

Blockchain is a great technology for certain usecases like digital money or smart contracts but not efficient to build a new internet with.

A newcomer in the IT space has been the rise of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is seen as technology that can improve on the delivery of decentralized compute and storage capacity – but can it? Looking at the same aspect of what needs to improve for this exponential growth in data creation and storage, it certainly delivers on certain aspects, but does not cover all of the requirements. Two to mention are that most blockchain technologies: 1. are far from sustainable and 2. certainly not usable by all of us they require a certain amount of "nerdiness" to be able to drive and interact with them.
