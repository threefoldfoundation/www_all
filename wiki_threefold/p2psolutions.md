# September 16: P2P Solutions – Another Look

![](threefold__p2psolutions.jpeg  )

ThreeFold has created the largest peer-to-peer cloud on the planet — but the Internet is more than just storage and capacity.

To fully realize the vision of an Internet built for everyone, by everyone, we need easy-to-use and easy-to-deploy alternatives to the online tools and applications we use most.

The first set of initial solutions will be provided by ThreeFold, and more are on the way. The rest are up to you! Using our manual (coming soon) and SDK, anyone can create and implement a new solution on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). What will YOU create?
