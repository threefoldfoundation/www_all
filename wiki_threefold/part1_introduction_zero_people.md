## Introduction

## The "cost" of complexity in traditional IT

Classic IT infrastructure setup is complex and is not cost-effective. Applications need a certain environment to operate in and this environment is built by integrating different technology components from different vendors. Example components of such a setup are: operating systems, storage systems, networks, security systems, authentication systems, etc etc.  

Putting components together is called (system) integrating, and integration requires agreement on how these components will fit together as well as the knowledge to do it.

This complexity and need for integration originate from the way the IT industry historically developed. Layer over layer has been added. Additional layers masked existing problems, and instead of fixing the underlying issues, several third parties needed to be involved. This added complexity and increased costs (such as license costs, upgrades, updates, remote hands etc.) Complexity has become a business model.
