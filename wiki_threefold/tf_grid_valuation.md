# TF Grid / Token (TFT) Valuation

![](threefold__makingimpact.png  )

The TF Grid's capacity is meeting the demand of one the fastest-growing markets globally. 

Demand for decentralized capacity is exploding with increasing data demands and trends such as Edge Computing, 5G, AI, VR, IoT and more. There is a direct relationship between the economic value of the TF Grid and the value of the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token). 

A [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) represents a unit of capacity (compute, storage & network) on the TF Grid. 

The combined valuation of all [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) in circulation can be expressed by the demand for capacity on the TF Grid, leading to a sound and transparent method of evaluation.


### The global cloud market is growing fast

Various reports from reputable resources such as 

- [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-04-02-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-g)
- [Markets and Markets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html)
- [IDC](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45340719) 

show that the global cloud market will double its revenues between 2018 and 2023. Currently (2020) it is valued at USD 249.8Bn.

The current growth rates only reflect the increasing demand of emerging technologies such as IoT, AI, autonomous driving and VR in developed countries that already have access to the Internet. They do not include the billions of people and potential future businesses from developing regions of our world.

### TF aims to connect the unconnected

Despite the fast-growing global cloud market, the distribution of data centers is still mostly concentrated on the western world (mainly Northern America) and certain parts of Asia.

- This [source](https://wikileaks.org/amazon-atlas/map/) lists the data centers of the current market leader in cloud capacity. 
- Other major market players follow the same patterns: 
  - [Oracle](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/oracle-launches-four-new-cloud-regions-across-four-continents)
  - [cloudwirx](https://www.cloudwirx.com/datacenters)
  - [Microsoft](https://yellowduckguy.wordpress.com/2018/03/15/microsoft-worldwide-data-center-locations/)

This unequal distribution of capacity can be explained by the high requirements in infrastructure, electricity, and security to operate large scale data centers that often require an investment of USD 1bn+ for setup.

With the [TF Grid](threefold__tfgrid.md) and TF Ecosystem, TF can also tap into the areas of our world where big cloud providers can't, thanks to its decentralized and autonomous nature. Also, this represents an opportunity for locals to boost their digital economies.

### The potential of the TF Grid

The TF Grid is a peer-to-peer Internet/Cloud grid, that provides more efficient solutions than centralized alternatives.

Considering the current global market growth, let's assume that the TF Grid achieves a 10% share of the 500 billion public cloud market by 2025. 

This would translate to a 50 billion USD (10% marketshare) demand to utilize the capacity of the TF Grid through [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) as the medium of exchange for capacity. 

Our simulation shows that this capacity requires about 75 million [3Node](threefold__3node)s to be deployed on the TF Grid globally.

## The ThreeFold_Token (TFT)

The [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) can be expanded indefinitely and independent farmers are incentivized to contribute to this expansion according to market demand.

The amount of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) in circulation in the market is however limited to a maximum of [4 billion [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)](threefold__token_liquidity.md).

In alignment with the above assumptions, 50 billion USD (10 perc marketshare) would meet a limited supply of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) that can never exceed 4 billion.

In the case that ThreeFold would only achieve a 1% market share (10x less as mentioned above), this still would lead to an expected demand of 5 billion USD worth of capacity. This demand will meet the limited circulating supply of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token).

### Sustainable growth vs hype

Market dynamics can lead to a higher valuation. Also, some [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) holders might not want to trade their tokens as they expect a future increase in value. 

This results in a lower liquid amount of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) meeting the 5 billion USD demand (keeping the same example as above). 

Expectations are proven when the price increases and the valuation can enter a hype cycle that feeds into itself, leading to an economic bubble. 

While this can lead to big speculative gains for some, these are always the losses of others.

TF does not support speculative bubbles and the worsening in global inequalities that can occur as a consequence.
