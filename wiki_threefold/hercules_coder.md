# Hercules Coder

![](threefold__coder1.png  )

## What

Hercules Coder presents an online coding environment which is accessible from any device that is able to run a web browser. This coding environment runs in your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) and provides you with a save, private and secure environment to do your coding work. It allows you to connect and store/retrieve code from any public open source and commercial code repositories supporting the git protocol.

The coding environment includes:

- A web based editor (see [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/), MIT open source license)
- An auto testing environment made available to the developer by the [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) this is called ZeroCI
- A decentralized code version control system that can be installed on the [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) (git based)

Basically everything required to run a full blown development environment in a [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) way.

## Features

- Runs anywhere in the world on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).
- Provides a secure and private connection to the development environment from anywhere, any device that supports the https protocol.
- Uses the git protocol to clone, push and pull coding in and out of the development environment.,

## Architecture

The system is a pure development environment allowing the developer to create, store and test code in one environment. This is done in a secure way by having all the required software run securely in a [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) on the TF Grid.

The [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) is a general-purpose compute and storage entity in which you can run different applications. The code server software package runs as a web service in your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) and presents secure interfaces (web browser, encrypted and secured traffic).

As a developer, you have numerous options to user as a trusted code base storage providers, as long as it supports the git protocol to manage content.

- Public and private hub like GitHub

## Main Benefits

- Secure web access to code editor and server
- Secure decentralised storage of created code
- Secure test environment to auto test the created code..
- No central components involved anywhere in this setup
- Enhanced co-editing capabilities and online collaboration
- [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) git based system.
- Integration with decentralized filesystems like ipfs

## Roadmap

### v1.0: Q4 2020

We can already demonstrate all features, but will go life in production end 2020.
