## Exchanging your fiat for digital currency.

For this part of the manual, we unfortunately cannot provide any screenshots other than the ones on display (Dutch Language) as this setting seems to be tied to the account holderâ€™s (in this case, a cool Dutch guy :)) nationality.

We'll be buying XLM (Stellar Lumens) in this scenario, which is Stellar's token.
