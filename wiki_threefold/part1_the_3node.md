# The 3Node 

![alt_text](threefold__3node.png  )

The [3Node](threefold__3node) is a physical box which is connected to the Internet or a local network. A [3Node](threefold__3node) can be deployed privately, as well as for high-security use cases. The [3Node](threefold__3node)s deliver the required capacity for the TF Grid.

The [3Node](threefold__3node) boot process is ultra-safe and cannot be intercepted by hackers. It is designed in such a way that no person, not even ourselves, has access to the internals of the [Zero-OS](threefold__zos).

We do this by means of strong integration with the physical hardware security and boot capabilities (e.g. secure-boot). There is no shell in [Zero-OS](threefold__zos), no user interface, and no RPC layer (remote procedure call).

The only way how the [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) can be commanded is by means of the Blockchain Database.

Core-0 is our main process manager which will deploy and manage our primitive workloads. There are three types of workloads: compute, storage, & network.
