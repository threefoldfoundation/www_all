## 1. Impact

Is a value-driven audience around the topics of sustainability, equality and sovereignty.
The communication that we branded the current threefold.io website is backed by the integral values of ThreeFold and its ecosystem. This opens up angles for collaborations and PR that we are exploring currently.

### Partnerships

- Our https://www.consciousinternet.org/ is also a major tool into this effort, we together with our partners create a force for good.
- Beautiful projects are coming life and they can help us to get to awareness (reach)
- Through our TDE = [Token Distribution Event](threefold__tdeoverview.md) we look for funding for the projects which will organically grow the grid.

### channels

#### Blogs & News websites

- We are talking to bloggers and journalists about publications on four related channels.

#### PR

- Our communication & messaging is not consistent enough and needs to be improved.
- We are looking for people who can help us to do this properly

#### Podcasts

- We identified a fairly large number of podcasts with respectable audiences that we are now approaching about interaction. That may be in the form of organic coverage or sponsorships.
- 4 of them already done (June 1 status) and responses are very good, for overview see http://kristof.threefold.me

## 2. Blockchain Ecosystem

This audience has already invested in cryptocurrencies before. It is tech-savvy and can see the advantages of our technology. Even though it seems like a natural match, ThreeFold is not an ICO/STO or comparable to those. We are defined and driven by our values at the core. It goes without saying that pump&dump or the generation of unhealthy hype is not what we are trying to achieve here.

We are positioned like the missing layer for friend blockchain projects, they are announced on our website and details can be found on our wiki.

The technological possibilities of the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) lead to many promising partnerships that are all in different phases of onboarding.

- Among the Blockchains that we are talking to are several of the top20 in market capitalization.
- Even more are in the top 70 in market capitalization. Many of those have communities with more than 50.000 members.

### Social Media Channels

- We are keeping our audience updated, are expanding our networks and with that, the number of shares for our content.
- We are doing regular community Zoom calls

### Influencers

- We are talking to two major influencers on Youtube
  One of them is already confirmed and will be announced soon
- We are receiving organic requests from reputable advisors from the crypto space. Each one of them has to be checked thoroughly if there is an alignment with our values and vision.
- 4 of them already done (June 1 status) and responses are very good, for overview see http://kristof.threefold.me

### Exchange Partners

- We are launching on a big crypto exchange that will assist us by reaching out to their community with announcements in exceptional ways.
- An exchange that had listed [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) before agreed to also assist us with marketing.
- We are exploring a trading contest that increases liquidity of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token).

### PR

- We are engaged with some consultants to help us reach this community.
