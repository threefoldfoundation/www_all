# Cloud Pricing (IT Capacity)

Cloud units are the basis for buying & selling capacity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) (more info see [here](threefold__cloud_units.md)).

- 1 CU = 1 compute unit
- 1 SU = 1 storage unit
- 1 NU = 1 network unit

Below you can see how the market prices these cloud units

#### Compute Conclusion

> sales price we suggest is between 10 and 15 USD for 1 compute unit (CU) <BR>
> in market this is between 36 and 202 USD

### Storage


A threefold compute unit is (SU)

- 1 TB of storage

#### Storage Conclusion

> sales price we suggest is between 6 and 12 USD for 1 storage uni (SU) <BR>
> in market this is between 19 and 154 USD
