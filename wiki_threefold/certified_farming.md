Factors the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) [Reputation Engine](threefold__reputation_engine) will look at:

- Bandwidth
- Utilization
- Uptime


> Note: Farmers who are interested to become certified need to sign a contract with [ThreeFold Tech](threefold__threefold_tech) in which the certification criteria are set. Once the contract is signed the farm will be measured against the certification criteria which shows exactly if the certification is deserved.
