## De<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">central</span>ized = Different centralized

Decentralized has the word centralized inside, but in a different way. 

The idea is not to make an organization or group of people the owner of a centralized system but rather the other way around â€“ you or any legal identity becomes the center of your own digital life.

Each human person or other legal entity (can be a trust, a company, or a government department) owns one [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def). This is the main [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) you interact with, and this [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) can own other [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s.

[3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s are the actors inside such a system. All data is owned **only** by [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s who are **owned** by the aforementioned human or legal entities. All [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s need to be registered in a digital phone book (implemented by means of blockchain technology).

Each entity (human or legal) can define multiple circles. These circles define how we interact with other [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s (access rights, searchability, etc).
