# Blockchain myths 

In order to investigate what potential right use cases exist for blockchain technologies let spend some time on some of the blockchain myths that have been created in recent years.  As with any new technology blockchains have been named as a miracle technology that that overcome many (if not any) of the challenges and difficulties that exist in modern day digital technology. Let’s name and investigate a few.


## Blockchains are “Super Scalable” 

Is it? Pure blockchain deployments are not super scalable compared to conventional (server-based) transaction methods.  Current financial blockchain transaction times are very slow compared to any other (currency) transaction technologies out there, being it card transactions like Mastercard, VISA, or money transfers from one bank account to another.


## Blockchain technology bring “Impeccable security” 

Very questionable... While blockchain is based on cryptographic standards, the methods to ensure privacy are entirely outside of any blockchain standards and implementations. It's every implementer's responsibility to ensure security. This means that security is largely handled as it is in the old (conventional?) world.


## When using blockchains “Trustworthiness is guaranteed” 

By what? Blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and information storage,  but  otherwise nothing really is inherently trustworthy about any fact stored on the blockchain. You need to corroborate trustworthiness by ensuring that the parties who store facts in the blockchain are incorruptible and that these facts are true —just as you would in the rest of the world without using blockchain technology.


## Blockchains can manage “Anything” 

Blockchain is a protocol expressed in code and this is not defined in terms of any standard. There are no standards bodies to provide sanctioned implementation rules or guidance.

Many contracts or types of data are better dealt with not on a blockchain: as it is a database that has only write and read functionality, but no update nor deletion is possible, it’s even dangerous to post sensitive and personal data on a blockchain, and if not used well, there might raise conflicts with regulations such as GDPR. However, a blockchain could be used to provide consensus where required.


## Smart contracts on the blockchain can do “Everything” 

Potentially but maybe not in the way how people see today. While this is technically true, in practice, blockchain is limited to simple and well-understood use cases, without ambiguities. Smart contracts are essentially rocket science. By design, once published (launched), you cannot revise or bug fix them.


## Blockchain deployments “If not public - go private!” 

Not the same thing…… Private blockchains are not the answer to privacy or restricted access to information. Purely private/enterprise blockchains might fail to realise any of the benefits of blockchain.


## A new feature “justifies deploying a new blockchain” 

Community-driven blockchain products are being forked left and right by private players who enhance them in various ways. But only the open source blockchains with the largest communities and install-plus-adoption bases will persist. The rest can be considered lab experiments and 99.9 percent of these will die horrible deaths.
