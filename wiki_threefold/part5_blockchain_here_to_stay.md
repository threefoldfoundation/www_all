# Blockchains are here to stay!

With all the hype around blockchain technology and also all the failed initiatives, blockchain technology does allow for digital worlds to exist without centralisation.  The information revolution has brought forward a lot of progress and innovation to the people however the outcome has also been only a few large organisations controlling all of it.

 

Examples are:



* Online search: Google
* Online social: Facebook, Tinder
* Online banking: any large international bank
* Online insurance:  few insurance alliances
* Customer Relationship management: SalesForce
* Enterprise Resource Management: Oracle, SAP
All these organisations are leading in their specific sector of digital innovation and some of them even provide services for free.  Nothing is for free in this world and in reality -in return for these services  you accept the terms and conditions which allow the companies to use your personal information and user statistics for their own benefits and make money from this behavior derived data.  

 

Most industry leaders have become so powerful that there is almost no way around them anymore and you are almost obliged to comply with their terms and conditions to do something useful with the internet today.

 

The world is awaking and is seeking alternatives in which data and information are not centrally controlled as in such monopolistic structures.  Blockchain technologies allow new solutions to be built without central governing bodies, creating person to person sharing and trading opportunities.
