## ThreeFold Farming Pool 

A Pool of storage & compute hardware which allows provision IT Capacity.

Each Farming Pool consists out of TFNodes which run the TF Operating System and TF Blockchain Software (TF Chain) which allows anyone in the world to use this IT capacity to host their IT workloads (storage apps, archive capacity, web applications, artificial intelligence, iOT, docker containers, etc). To use this IT Capacity, through the TF Grid, people need to own [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s (“[TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s”) as they are the only possible mechanism to purchase this capacity on the TF Grid. As such, [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s represent a true utility.
