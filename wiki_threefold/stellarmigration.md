# May 21: TFT Migration to Stellar

Dear existing [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) Holders,

We are excited to share that the migration from the Rivine Blockchain to the [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) Blockchain has started.

[Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) is an open-source network for currencies and payments. [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) makes it possible to create, send, and trade digital representations of all forms of money ‚Äì dollars, pesos, bitcoin ‚Äì pretty much anything. It‚Äôs designed so all the world‚Äôs financial systems can work together on a single network.

The [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) ([TFT](threefold__threefold_token)) now lives on the [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain). [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) Holders benefit from a big ecosystem of proven wallets and mediums of exchange. Stellar‚Äôs mission to promote financial inclusion is aligned with ThreeFold‚Äôs vision for an inclusive Internet.

All you need to do is convert your [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) to [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)A on [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain).

For most of you, the conversion will happen automatically the next time you open your [ThreeFold Connect](threefold__tfconnect) app, but make sure to update the app first.

If you‚Äôre unsure of anything or if you have not migrated from the ThreeFold app to [ThreeFold Connect](threefold__tfconnect) yet, [here](threefold__tf_chain_to_stellar_chain.md) is a simple guide to make sure the conversion goes smoothly. üôè
