## ThreeFold Farmer

![](threefold__whatisafarmer.png  )

TF Farmers farm [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s by connecting hardware to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

As a result of farming, Internet capacity is generated and made available on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

A Farmer earns tokens in 2 ways:

- Farming: as a result of connecting server/storage hardware to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid)
- Cultivation: as a result of their Farming Pool capacity being utilised (sold) by [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) Users

There are two types of capacity farmers:

- Certified Farmers: A certified hardware using farmer that has entered into, and is compliant with, the present Terms of the [ThreeFold Tech](threefold__threefold_tech) Service Level Agreement.
- DIY Farmers: Use their own choice of hardware (uncertified hardware).
