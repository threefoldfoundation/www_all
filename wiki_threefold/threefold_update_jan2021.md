# ThreeFold's 2020 Rewind Community Update

![](threefold__update2020rewind.png  )

**2020 was quite a year**. None of us could have predicted how it would unfold. It was a year filled with adaptation and perseverance, and **it is clear we are living in times of great change.**

For ThreeFold, **2020 was a year that strengthened our resolve** – with the pandemic and all that came with it bringing further proof that new solutions like ours are so needed. **It was a year filled with major technological milestones and blossoming partnerships** that will set up a crucial 2021!

Here is a look back.

## Major highlights from 2020

### From Grid 2.0 to 2.4

In April, we announced the launch of the second generation of the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). This was a major milestone! Our Grid 2.0 brought the Smart Contract for IT concept, lots of updates to our [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) operating system, Kubernetes support, Web Gateway (the network wall feature which allows you to bridge internet towards your internal workload), the [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) Server (your personal system administrator), a [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) SDK (allows you to extend the solution yourself), and many more features.

This first release was tailored towards developers.

In Dec 2020 (and Jan 2021) we worked on our 2.4 release on testnet which brings:

- **[edge Virtual Datacenter (eVDC)](https://vdc.threefold.io/)**: a Kubernetes-compatible cloud with great features around security and networking. Deploy any Linux-compatible workload anywhere in our grid within minutes. We have full support for the Kubernetes ecosystem like Helm templates, Prometheus monitoring, traffic ingress controller, & more.
- **Planetary FileSystem**: a virtual filesystem compatible with Linux, OS X and soon Windows. You can now from anywhere in the world store data on our grid with following incredible features: quantum safe, unbreakable, read/write caching, & more. This storage interface can be used for all your storage requirements: backup, archive, fileserver, and even small databases.
- **[ThreeFold Now Community Tools](https://now.threefold.io)**: (updates here, TF Now was introduced previously) easy-to-install tools on top of the eVDC to create your own professional workgroups or leisure communities. Included are amazing tools like alternatives to YouTube, Slack, Zoom, & Office, developer tools, and more.
- **Python-based Developer SDK**: super easy to install and use for developers.
- & more – full release notes coming soon!

Grid 2.4 is now live on testnet and you can begin testing tomorrow, January 13th, 2021. We are [inviting everyone](https://t.me/joinchat/TSI25Ee-RcQaOmieYJ9Yyg) to test this release. Note: we are aiming to bring this to mainnet within 1 month.

Unfortunately our documentation is behind, something we are working on right now.

### We created a full new web presence

We worked hard on our web presence and created:

- A new and fully-updated [website](https://threefold.io)
- Lots of information in our [wiki systems](https://wiki.threefold.io) (it became a very extensive library of information)
- A [forum](https://forum.threefold.io)
- A [manual](https://manual.threefold.io) for developers working with our TF Grid

We are getting very good response on the wealth of information and the level of detail. The biggest comment we get is that it's too much info, and we need a more focused and targeted approach per selected audience. Something we are working on these days!

### ThreeFold_Token (TFT) moved to Stellar

In March, the **TFT moved to the [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) Network** and is now also part of [[Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain)'s Decentralized Exchange](threefold:how_to_buy_and_sell?id=how-to-sell).
> **ERROR: link, cannot find page: threefold:how_to_buy_and_sell?id=how-to-sell.
IError(Error{
    msg: 'cannot find the file: threefold:how_to_buy_and_sell?id=how-to-sell'
    code: 0
}) **<BR>



On June 1, the **TFT was listed on both [Liquid](https://app.liquid.com/exchange/TFTBTC) and [BTC-Alpha](https://btc-alpha.com/en/exchange/TFT_BTC)**.

Before doing a large-scale promotion campaign, we are working on the following requirements:

1. We are setting up our TF Foundation in Switzerland and revisiting our core structure (today based in Dubai).
2. We are working with investors and will organize a private sale of our tokens to get funding for the TF Foundation and launch.
3. We want to have our 2.5 release on production net (which will make it easy for everyone to start using the grid, developers as well as novice IT users) and deployed with 80% of our farmers. Now on testnet as 2.4, should be 2.5 on mainnet by latest Feb 2021.
4. We are preparing a full marketing campaign which will launch once above is done.

### We built out a blockchain ecosystem

Throughout 2020 **we worked with some top-tier Blockchain protocols and dApps** to demonstrate ThreeFold's ability to solve the blockchain dilemma with our TF Grid technology. These partnerships revolve around utilizing ThreeFold's edge storage and compute for partners' blockchain workloads as well as decentralizing their networks of nodes.

As a summary, here are the awesome Blockchain partners that joined the ThreeFold ecosystem in 2020:

- DigiByte
- TomoChain
- SelfKey
- Neo
- Dash
- WaykiChain
- Harmony
- HoloChain
- Skale Labs
- Matic Network
- Presearch
- PKT.cash

During the spring and summer, we announced these partnerships, and **received some key coverage**:
