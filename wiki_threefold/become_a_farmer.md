## Preconfigured Servers

![4ig ThreeFold Farming](threefold__4ignodes.jpg  )

ThreeFold certified hardware designed and built by HPE. These pre-configured servers are optimized for maximum token earnings.

In the future [3Node](threefold__3node)s will be eligible for Certification by various providers to increase trust and potential return on investment.

You would be required to provide your own hosting as well as setup and administer your own farm.

There are different sizes in various price points available. These nodes are mainly for professional usage in data centers.

If you want to purchase for delivery in European countries visit **[4IG Node Shop](https://threefold.4ig.hu/)**

For any other countries please contact andreas@threefold.tech

## Do It Yourself (DIY) Servers

Create your own [3Node](threefold__3node) by installing [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) on your own standard server hardware. It must have an Intel or AMD CPU and can have any number and type of hard drives (HDD/SSD).

#### Our recommendations for server hardware configuration:

- a ratio of 1 : 4 between vCPU and GB memory
- at least 1 SSD for storage
- if you add HDDs please check if there is enough bandwidth available to have enough performance for storage capacity usage.

In the future [3Node](threefold__3node)s will be eligible for Certification by various providers to increase trust and potential return on investment.

You would be required to provide your own hosting as well as setup and administer your own farm.

Purchase your server hardware from any supplier or use your existing server hardware.

> Both the 'Preconfigured Servers' and the 'DIY Servers' mean that you need technical expertise to create your own farm and add your servers to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). Details can be found [here](https://sdk.threefold.io/#/farm_setup_management)
