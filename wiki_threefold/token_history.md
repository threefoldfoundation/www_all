# The path from TFT v1 towards TFT v2

## Quick history overview

- More than 10 years ago this project started from out of our incubator see https://www.incubaid.com
- Almost 4 years ago TF Foundation Dubai started deploying capacity for development purposes
  - this became our ([our genesis pool](threefold__genesis_pool.md)), which is the beginning of farming
  - in 2017-18 value of the genesis pools were about 7m USD in [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) (tokens did not exist yet)
  - Genesis pools are owned by ThreeFold Foundation (ThreeFold_Dubai Dubai).
- A little over 2 years ago (March 2018) our first-generation blockchain for the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) saw the daylight.
  - The [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) v1 was launched on a blockchain called Rivine (PTO).
  - The genesis pool resulted in the first batch initial [TFT](threefold__threefold_token).
  - The blockchain nodes were hosted by +30 different parties completely unrelated to each other.
- A little over a year ago (Q2 2019) TF Foundation Dubai launched our generation 1 of our TF Grid.
- April 2020 [ThreeFold Dubai](threefold__threefold_dubai) Dubai [launched the TFGrid v2.0](threefold__threefold_grid_2_0.md) which is now public and usable by the world.
  - TF Foundation Dubai has a new website and a new wiki (https://wiki.threefold.io)
  - a manual on how to use the TF Grid 2.0 (see https://manual.threefold.io).
  - the farmers & [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) token holders have at their own will upgraded their wallets, zero-nodes, ...
- May 2020: [ThreeFold Dubai](threefold__threefold_dubai) Dubai launched our 2nd version of our token called [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) but this time on [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain)
  - the original TFTv1 kept all same properties and benefits and is now called TFTA also on [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) (is technology choice)
  - TF Foundation Dubai has provisioned the TFTv1 & TFTv2 on [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) blockchain, but has no influence or access to any of the wallets or for that matter the [3Node](threefold__3node)s (The boxes providing IT capacity)
  - see below for more info, this was the result of 12 months of work with our community and of-course consensus to do this.

## migration

### migration from TFTv1 Rivine to TFTv1 Stellar

- [ThreeFold Tech](threefold__threefold_tech) decided to no longer support development of Rivine, at this time there are better technologies available as blockchain.
- The Foundation investigated many blockchain platforms & recommended to use [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain)
- Jimber (company which maintains the wallet, which is open source code), has made the changes in the wallet to be able to support this new blockchain.
- The conversation had to be a mandatory one, because otherwise there would be the potential of double spending problems over both at the same time active blockchains.
- What happened here can be compared to a website deciding to change the database backend (change from e.g. MS Sql to Oracle). The users of the website should not have to be aware of this migration.
- Every user had to do the transaction themselves, no developer or anyone else had control over this migration step. This was an automatic step.
- Everyone can use the validation scripts available to check the correct conversion between 2 blockchain technologies. The validation scripts prove that every transaction in the conversion happened well.

### migration from TFTv1 Stellar (Staking Pool=TFTA) to TFTv2 Stellar (Trading or Production Pool=TFT)

- see [tfta_to_tft](threefold__tfta_to_tft.md)

## Status Nov 2020:

- limited liquidity on the public exchanges, this means most users who want to sell will not find the liquidity yet.
- TF has planned more marketing activities to improve the liquidity situation, but expect organic growth.
- More info see [token_liquidity](threefold__token_liquidity.md)
