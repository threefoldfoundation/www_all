Today weâ€™re proud to introduce you to Artheon, a member of the Conscious Internet Alliance. Artheon is a Virtual Reality museum offering immersive, next-level interaction with objects of cultural heritage.

Artheon is hosted on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), allowing the museum to share free global access to history, art, and culture across geographical and national borders in a truly decentralized manner.
