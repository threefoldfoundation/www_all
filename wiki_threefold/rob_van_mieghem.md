# Rob Van Mieghem - @robvanmieghem

Equality of opportunity is a fundamental right in my opinion.

So is privacy that goes beyond being a personal right as it is a necessity for democracy to function.

A better world is something that starts with yourself.


Technology today does not sufficiently suppport my personal believes of how a bettter world might look like, especially not how it is made available to the majority of the world population.
 
I'm a nerd and proud of it so let's start doing what is right.
