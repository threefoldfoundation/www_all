## ThreeFold Token (TFT)

![](threefold__token_internet.png  )

ThreeFold Token is the token of the new internet. It is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, applications) on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) â€“ generated only when active capacity is added to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

It has a specific commercial utility, since [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s were conceived as the designated currency for buying and selling capacity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

[TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s have not simply been minted and there was never an initial coin offering of any kind. [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s are exclusively produced through a process called farming, which means that [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s are generated only when new Internet capacity is added to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). There is no wasteful mining.

[TFT](threefold__threefold_token) is part of the [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) Network (https://stellar.org).
