### A little history on blockchain technology 


Everyone thinks that Satoshi Nakamoto invented blockchain technology when he published his whitepaper in January 2009 which would make a digital currency the first use case. But it was not!.

In 1991, Dr W. Scott Stornetta  published a white paper in which he introduced the idea of a ‘blockchain’ as a decentralised, database where digital transactions are secured. The cryptographers’ research focused on creating a digital hierarchy system which time-stamped and chronologically secured transactions in a chain of blocks.  The first considered use case for blockchain technology was to digitally sign and store land deeds (see whitepaper). The distinguishing characteristics of this new proposed technology were decentralisation and immutability of stored transaction data.

 

Satoshi was the person or group of persons that used these blockchain principles to create a digital currency.  The rest of the story is known - out of one many digital currencies based on different creation principles (also referred to as cryptocurrencies, digital coins etc.) have been launched and existed  for over a decade and have completed their first hype cycle.
