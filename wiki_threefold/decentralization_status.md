# Decentralization Status

![](threefold__decentralization33.png  )

We believe we are good under way to be a decentralized movement.

There are more than 100 independent active parties building the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) today.

## Good enough and available today

- Token on a public blockchain, in this case [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain), this provides very good security and decentralization for everyone
- Token can be exchanged on [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) decentralized exchange and other decentralized exchanges
- Independent farmers, all capacity registered on TFDirectory (our TFExplorer) and signed by Farmer [3Node](threefold__3node).
- ALL technology open source and everyone can see progress, ask for feature requests, check/audit the code, ...
- The [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) IT workloads are distributed using the smart contract for IT (multi-signature capability)
- [ThreeFold Foundation](threefold__threefold_foundation) is promotion only (Mazraa which is sub-brand is also a farmer)
- Measurement of capacity done per [3Node](threefold__3node)
- Measurement of uptime done per [3Node](threefold__3node) and distributed
- Minting (creation of new tokens) all done by means of code and validated by [ThreeFold Grid Guardian](threefold__grid_guardians)s
- Every minting operation since start of the blockchain creates a proof document
  - The hash is put in the transaction of the minting operation
  - Means there is proof of every minting operation
  - Also [block0](threefold__genesis_block_pool_details.md) has been documented
- Multi signature wallet for rewarding people with gifted [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) for contributions done
- [ThreeFold Foundation](threefold__threefold_foundation) & [ThreeFold Tech](threefold__threefold_tech) use a priority management tool to let everyone have input on priorities and manage work well (see circles.threefold.me)
- Our council structure see [threefold_councils](threefold__threefold_councils.md) is like a human blockchain and protects the values of ThreeFold.

## New Decentralization planned for H2 2021

- As part of our [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) 3.0 we have a new exciting blockchain capabilities
  - multi blockchain: [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain), parity and now looking into Polkadot parachain.
  - money & consensus separated blockchain
  - see [TFGrid 3.0 Consensus mechanism specifications = technical](tftech__consensus3_mechanism.md).
  - [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) data objects are stored on Parity based decentralized blockchain database (phonebook, tfdirectory)
- TF has been designed to be decentralized, many farmers together provide the infrastructure for the new internet built by everyone for everyone. 
  - We are now preparing the next phase, we want to create 2-3 legal global structures in which we can accept funding and get approval from the government for the structure and token.
    - This will have an impact on how to organize our Foundation. 
    - restructuring will be done done in Be, Dubai & Switzerland.
    - as part of our ThreeFold_30 launch we hope to be able to sell some Foundation tokens which can fund for these operations.

## Perception

- We can always improve on Perception
  - Some people perceive the foundation as too centralized, the foundation is only a promotion vehicle, need to make sure everyone understands this and sees how we reach out to the community for advice.
  - Some people have multiple hats on (e.g. Kristof works for [ThreeFold Foundation](threefold__threefold_foundation) and for [ThreeFold Tech](threefold__threefold_tech)), we believe there is no conflict of interest today because the "interest" is 100% aligned between [ThreeFold Tech](threefold__threefold_tech) and [ThreeFold Foundation](threefold__threefold_foundation).
  - We need to be more vocal about the fact that we are a community, its not some people dictating direction, we use our own priority management tool to coordinate on decisions, see circles.threefold.me.

## Remark: we believe in good of people and relying on "human" blockchains

We believe in the good of people, thats why we have implemented our council structure.

- We are using code (software) to do all the minting (creation of tokens), in v2.0 we still use a Human Blockchain to validate the minting operation (validation of the minting).
- The code used in this process is open source and can be found in the code repos.
- Remark, we found out that this actually a requirement for the possibility to become a licensed token/digital currency in certain regions.

> DISCLAIMER: the checks (validation of transactions) as done by any of our Councils or community members do not imply any guarantee or impose any liabilities on ThreeFold Foundation of any of the related parties.
