# Using BTC-Alpha (Available April 29)

BTC-Alpha was the first online cryptocurrency exchange to support [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s (TFT).

They offer the following trading options:

- [TFT-BTC](https://btc-alpha.com/exchange/TFT_BTC/)
- [TFT-USD](https://btc-alpha.com/exchange/TFT_USD/)

While BTC-Alpha supports buying [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s with USD (second option here above), we recommend that you first acquire Bitcoins as indicated in Buy [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s from an online exchange, and then exchange Bitcoins for [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s (the first option here above).

So once you have acquired Bitcoins, go through following steps to buy and sell [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s using BTC-Alpha:

- [Registration](#registration)
- [Login](#login)
- [Enable two-factor authentication](#two-factor)
- [Deposit BTC](#deposit-btc)
- [Exchange](#exchange-panel)
- [Buy TFT](#buy-tft)
- [Withdraw TFT](#withdraw)
- [Deposit TFT](#deposit-tft)

> As indicated here below in the section [Withdraw TFT](#withdraw), we highly recommend that you also install the [ThreeFold App](threefold__threefold_app.md) to keep your [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s offline in your ThreeFold App wallet.

## Enable two-factor authentication

> It is not recommended to keep your funds permanently on a public exchange or use a public exchange as a wallet, because exchanges are more likely to be hacked than your personal wallet.

It is highly recommended to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your BTC-Alpha account.

To do that, first install **Authy** or **Google Authenticator** on your mobile phone: - https://authy.com/download/ - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en - https://itunes.apple.com/ae/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8

Then configure 2FA by going through the process on **TWO FACTOR AUTH** page:

## Withdraw TFT

> It is not recommended to keep your [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s permanently in an online [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) wallet, as provided by online cryptocurrency exchanges such as BTC-Alpha, because online wallets are more likely to get hacked than offline wallets.
