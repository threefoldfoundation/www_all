# Unit

![](https://www.consciousinternet.org/threefold/info/projects/unit/unit.png)

*The Unit* is an underlying technology which powers two-sided marketplaces (like uber, or airbnb) which powers a platform for a specific vertical or industry. Unit also invests in these projects and companies through Unit Ventures, with the vision to create millions of jobs, and support projects by allocating funds and resources to them.

### Purpose

We believe well-being of all is important, and are committed to creating opportunities and solving inequality in the world by moving towards being structured as a cooperative, this means that the value created is distributed with the customers and providers, not just the founders and the investors. This will ultimately solve the huge income inequity. We believe this will give an opportunity for people to do good, and focus on what they enjoy, rather than simply making money to support themselves.
