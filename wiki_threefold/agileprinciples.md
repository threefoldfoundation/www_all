# Agile Principles


![](threefold__agile_team_kids.png  )

Agile principles are a way how work can be organized, originally it was mainly done for code collaboration, but we believe it can be easily adjusted to any team working together in an organization.

We found the following principles on the internet and liked them so much we have adjusted them slightly and published them here. Original content from [here](https://www.101ways.com/category/10-key-principles-of-agile/).

Agile collaboration relies on close cooperation between all team members and stakeholders.

Agile principles include keeping requirements and documentation lightweight, and acknowledging that change is normal.

This makes close collaboration particularly important to clarify requirements just-in-time and to keep all team members (including the story owner) ‘on the same page’ throughout the collaboration.
