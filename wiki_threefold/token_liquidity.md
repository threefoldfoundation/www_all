# The Liquidity of TFT

![](threefold__limitedsupply.png  )


The following items will help drive liquidity:

## There are not enough TFT

Like every item, service or currency, [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) derives a part of its value from scarcity. Thus the scarcity adds value to [TFT](threefold__threefold_token), which lets all [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) holders benefit. They are ensured that their assets can´t be reduced in value by inflation.

The way how the [minting/farming](threefold__minting_logic.md) works means that there are not enough [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) available.

The commercial capability of a box is at least 6 times bigger than the total of the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) created over 4 years per [3Node](threefold__3node) (box).

This leads to a shortage of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) and sound a economical principle.

## There is a maximum of 4 billion TFT

While the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) can expand infinitely as long as there is demand for capacity, a maximum of 4 Billion [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s can be in circulation. This limit ensures stability of value and incentivization for all stakeholders.

The future value of the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) can be Billions, this should have impact on the value of the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token).

Also see [token valuation](threefold__tf_grid_valuation.md).

## Sound Token Distribution

We believe ThreeFold [Token Distribution](threefold__token_distribution.md) is very fair and leads to promotion and expansion of the project.

## Natural Economic Demand

The [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) is the largest decentralized network of capacity in the world. It is attracting developers to build applications that run on its capacity. This is incentivized by many benefits that the users of these applications can enjoy: 100% ownership of their data, superior reliability through decentralized hosting, guaranteed and transparent execution of software through the [Smart Contract for IT](tftech__smart_contract_for_it.md), and many more benefits. Developers can rent capacity from the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) in exchange for [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) (only; no other currencies are used) and this is what creates a natural economic demand. We call this process cultivation.

You can learn more on how to deploy applications and other workloads on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) [here](https://cloud.threefold.io/).

> The [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) liquidity will grow as the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) will grow and be used more.

## We are a drop in the ocean today.

While we might be the largest network today of decentralized capacity, it's still very small compared to the big centralized cloud vendors. There is a lot of room for growth.

The document about [Grid Valuation](threefold__tf_grid_valuation.md) shows how the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) maybe could grow to a 10% share of the current public cloud market. This would equal 500 billion USD by 2025 and translate to a 50 billion USD demand to utilize the capacity of the TF Grid through [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) as the medium of exchange for capacity. This will eventually drive liquidity.

> WE ARE ONLY AT THE BEGINNING.

## Stability vs Hype: Hoarding Nature of TFT at this point.

Some [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) holders (e.g. as a result of farming) might not want to sell their tokens at this point because they expect a further increase in value. This results in a lower liquid amount of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token).

> We do not believe in hype or speculation as mechanisms to drive ThreeFold or [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) value !

Expectations are proven when the price increases and the valuation can enter a hype cycle that feeds into itself, leading to an economic bubble. While this can lead to big speculative gains for some, these are always the losses of others. TF does not support speculative bubbles and the worsening in global inequalities that can occur as a consequence. Therefore we won't participate in marketing activities that artificially inflate the price of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token). We believe in a fair evaluation of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) from the economic demand for the capacity of the TF Grid instead.

## Vesting Pools

Tokens farmed go in a vesting pool. Until v2.0 of [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) this was a voluntary process but starting v3.0 this will be mandatory.

See [Vesting Pool](threefold__vesting_pool.md)

## Staking of TFT: Hoarding VS Velocity

A complementary currency expert has suggested the following strategy which is based upon the differences between’ hoarding’ & ‘velocity’ based tokens. TF believes it merits serious consideration by the TF Community.

The idea is to promote the hoarding values of our tokens at this early stage and then to later emphasize velocity once the network has reached a critical mass.

More and more blockchain projects use “staking” to improve scarcity. Staking is not a financial trick, it's a very logical process to reward people to hold tokens rather than selling them, how might TF do this?

Farmers receive TF tokens as a reward for making an investment in hardware, the earlier they invest the lower the difficulty factor so the more [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) are farmed.

Our suggestion is that capacity users will receive substantial discounts on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) by staking tokens, which means [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) goes into a wallet which can only be used for buying ThreeFold IT capacity. An example might be, if you need 1k USD capacity per month, but you buy 2 year in advance (24K USD) you get upto 60% discount (9.6K USD).

This is a very logical approach, by buying & staking so many tokens upfront a capacity user basically becomes a co-owner of the already deployed capacity, this way the farmer can already sell some tokens to allow them to pay for their operational expenses and further hardware investment.

Another suggestion to implement a more generic form of staking is to give a percentage from cultivated & farmed [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) to the staking pool.
