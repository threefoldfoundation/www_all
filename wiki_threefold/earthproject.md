![alt](https://www.consciousinternet.org/threefold/info/projects/climate_action_project/climate_action_project.png)

Every child deserves an education. For years we have been working to bring positive and needed changes to the education system through our organization Take Action Global (TAG). Today, with technological advancements in place, we can bring this another step forward, we call this next step _The Climate Action Project_.

### Purpose

We want to raise the bar of education by having experts to teach students as well as initiate teacher training with the help of technology. Peer-to-peer education is another step forward. It opens up the possibilities for learning and bringing positive solutions for our world.

### Status Today

We at [TAG](http://takeactionglobal.org/) have built a community of thousands of teachers globally which allows us to connect to children and teachers in refugee camps. This allows us to train teachers in refugee camps (67% of which haven't completed secondary education) and facilitate interactions between refugee students and students globally, changing their mindset and fighting polarization. Today, we face limitations with technology including affordability of and access to the internet.

With ThreeFold as the infrastructure, and utilizing elements of [Crystal Twin](threefold__crystaltwin) technology, we are developing Climate Action Project, a peer-to-peer education platform that affordably and effectively bridges refugees with other students and educators around the world.
