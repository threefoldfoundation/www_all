# TFChain Node

A node in the [ThreeFold Chain](threefold__tfchain).

Is a parity based blockchain node.

Used as backend for all [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) blockchain operations.

This is a highly effective blockchain which has "just" enough information but not more, all the additional info comes from the [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) effect of our network.
