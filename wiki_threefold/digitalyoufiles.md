*The [Digital Twin](threefold__digitaltwin) Files* 

*The [Digital Twin](threefold__digitaltwin) Files* provides functionality to store (personal) files in a secure and private way. The [Digital Twin](threefold__digitaltwin) Files solution uses your personal digital twin (see Crystal Twin project) to store and retrieve files from storage capacity rented on the TF Grid. Files are stored securely in a very efficient way, using a lot less storage space to do so and also in a much more sustainable manner.

### Purpose

- neutral and allows you to own all your data
- faster
- simple and easy to use
- more cost effective
- able to work everywhere 
- equipped of advanced features like video/audio streaming
- able to seamlessly integrate with other website and documents

### Status Today
