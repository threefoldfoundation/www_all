## Is ThreeFold Technology 100% autonomous today?

Does a 100% autonomous IT system exist today? To our knowledge, the answer is **no**. At ThreeFold, we are not there yet, **but we are very close. We believe we are further advanced** compared to any other startup or technology vendor in this space. To achieve what we have to date, we had to reinvent a blockchain, an operating system, and a self-healing autonomous IT system â€“ none of which are small feats.

**We are very close**

Our [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) & Zero-Chain is usable and deployed today. The [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) is the first deployment of this unique technology and has been activated Q2 2018.

There are more than 15.000 CPU cores and +40.000.000 GB of storage activated with this technology.

The capacity layer is available since Q2 2019 in test, production Jan 1 2020.
This layer allows anyone to use the grid as decentralized alternative to existing clouds.

Through a blockchain you define the workloads you want and it becomes reality. The large majority of workloads running on existing clouds can run on on our TF Grid today.

The Autonomous layer is next and available for early adopters.
