# DigitalTwin Meet

![](threefold__digitalyoumeet.png  )

We believe that a video conferencing solution like FreeFlow connect has a lot of potential on top of the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), mostly considering latest news about privacy issues on biggest solutions. This central infrastructure needs enormous connectivity and hardware to connect large numbers of people. FreeFlow Connect creates peer-to-peer connections.

### Purpose

Provide private, independent, and peer-to-peer video conferencing. Other conference solutions use centralized infrastructure and software to connect people. Millions of people are looking for a neutral Video Conferencing solution which is:

- neutral and allows you to own all your data
- faster
- offers high-quality imaging
- simple and easy to use
- more cost effective
- able to work everywhere

### Status Today

- We have a full blown first version active and ready to be launched
- We are now fundraising to make the next generations
- The FreeFlow connect is a huge project and has many technical challenges but we already got very far

Improvements compared to market

Create an independent and private peer-to-peer video conferencing solution. Using peer-to-peer technology avoids creating large bottlenecks in the center of the solution which can lead to loss of quality of video and audio signal. On the privacy front it makes sure that nobody can steal information about what is being communicated. A private video conferencing solution.
