1. Click the top-right menu icon

2. Click "Assets & Balances"

3. Click "+ Add Asset To You Account"

4. Type "TFT" in the search box

5. Click "Add Asset To Account" (this will cost you a small amount of XLM to set up a so-called trustline for the asset)

The [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) icon will now show in your Wallet overview.
