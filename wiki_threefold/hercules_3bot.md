## What is Hercules System Administrator?

Hercules System Administrator is a unique facility on the TF Grid where the system administrator represent you as a developer or system integrator digitally.  Secure access to your system integrator ([3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)) is provided by a cryptographic 2 factor authentication mechanism by an app on a device near you which contains yout private key. This private key is used to sign an access request to your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) which is being verified by your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) with your public key.

The [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) has a number of built in capabilities which allow you to create and operate large scale architectures on the TF Grid all owned and managed by the digital system administrator.  Standard capabilities on of the [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def):
- digital currency (wallet) management
- packaging system that allows for capabilities to be installed, deleted and additional ones created.
- full alerts and login insight to what is happening in / by your digital system administrator
- integrated wiki system which provides the latest updates to documentation on the TF Grid, the ThreeFold foundation in general and the use cases and technology updates to the system administrator.
