# 3Node

![](threefold__tf_grid.png  )

Computers (servers) are the low-level provider for the IT capacity of the Cloud, we call them [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) Nodes or in short a `3Node`.

[Zero-OS](threefold__zos) = [ZOS](threefold__zos.md) is the operating system which allows the [3Node](threefold__3node)s to be used to provide IT capacity required by the solutions running on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

They provide storage, compute & networking capacities. Together, [3Node](threefold__3node)s make up the capacity layers for the TF Grid.

Today we have about thousands of [3Node](threefold__3node)s across the grid see our https://explorer.grid.tf
