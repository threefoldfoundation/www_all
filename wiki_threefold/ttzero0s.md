![](threefold__ttzero0s.jpeg  )

[Zero-OS](threefold__zos) is a lightweight and ultra-efficient open source operating system invented by ThreeFold Tech, which runs on all servers (3Nodes) connected to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

It was build from scratch on a Linux Kernel to remove all the unnecessary complexity found on contemporary OS's.

[Zero-OS](threefold__zos) supports a small number of primitives, the low-level functions the operating system can perform natively. There is no shell, local nor remote. It does not allow for inbound network connections to happen.

[Zero-OS](threefold__zos) enables a "zero people" (autonomous) Internet, meaning hackers cannot get in and no chance for error by IT professionals.

Please visit [the Zero-OS repository](https://github.com/Threefoldtech/zos/tree/master/docs) on Github to learn more!
