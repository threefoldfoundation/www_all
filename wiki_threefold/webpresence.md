# Webpresence Update

In an ongoing effort to keep the community up to speed with the latest information, we‚Äôve updated our web presence to reflect the two key areas of focus:

1. the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), hosted on threefold.io (https://threefold.io/), and contains information related to the technology, farming and the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token), and

2. the ThreeFold Foundation, hosted on threefold.foundation (https://threefold.foundation/), and contains information related to the larger mission, vision and ecosystem support.

In addition, we've updated our wikis q (https://wiki.threefold.io/)uite significantly to make information more clear and navigation more simple.

We‚Äôre excited to bring you more content and announcements over the coming weeks, as well as additional ways to participate on the grid and in our growing community. Thank you for being with us! üôè
