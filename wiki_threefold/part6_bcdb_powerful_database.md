## BCDB

Our powerful Blockchain database.

The blockchain database has the following features:



*   Schemas (strongly typed)
*   3 types of indexing: key-based, full text search, and a full SQL compliant indexer
*   Multiple interfaces: REST, Redis, JavaScript client,, Python auto-generated client
*   Large and small objects can be stored (MBs to bytes)
*   All expected features from a blockchain are part of this product (e.g. immutability, verification, consensus, etc)
*   Encryption of data
*   We can guarantee full privacy for e.g. GDPR regulations (data is always 100% private, not shared)
*   ACLs = Access Control Lists
*   Multisignature
    *   For validation of new data
    *   For an update of data
    *   For invalidation (like delete, but data never really goes away â€“ just becomes invalid)

Supported interfaces: WebDav, Redis, REST \

Depending on the type of required indexing, different support backend data storage or indexing systems are used. The main supported backend storage device is Zero-DB.
