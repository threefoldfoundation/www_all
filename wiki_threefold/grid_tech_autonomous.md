# ThreeFold_Grid: The Autonomous Layer

## De<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">central</span>ized = Different centralized

Decentralized has the word centralized inside, but in a different way. 

The idea is not to make an organization or group of people the owner of a centralized system but rather the other way around – you or any legal identity becomes the center of your own digital life.



![alt_text](threefold__inspired_by_nature.png  )


Each human person or other legal entity (can be a trust, a company, or a government department) owns one [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def). This is the main [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) you interact with, and this [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) can own other [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s.



![alt_text](threefold__3bot_for_all.png  )


[3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s are the actors inside such a system. All data is owned **only** by [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s who are **owned** by the aforementioned human or legal entities. All [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s need to be registered in a digital phone book (implemented by means of blockchain technology).


![alt_text](threefold__3bot_grid_node.png  )


Each entity (human or legal) can define multiple circles. These circles define how we interact with other [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s (access rights, searchability, etc). 

# The circular smart IT system = “3Bot” powered


![alt_text](threefold__you_become_the_center.png  )


Our IT system is usable for companies, governments, citizens, schools, and so on. The system has the right balance between resilience and efficiency. A lot of services are already available today.

## Circles define your interest groups

![alt_text](threefold__circles.png  )


Circles are the groups you define, with whom you share your information.

There is 0% centralization in this system. Blockchains are used where a shared state is required.

# 3Bot = Digital Avatar = Digital Self 

Your Digital Avatar (the 3Bot) has been designed to be as efficient as possible. The current memory footprint is less than 200MB yet still it is a wiki system, database, blockchain, web server, indexing & search machine, e-commerce system, wallet, decentralized exchange, and more. It can manage millions of objects and is the center of your company or your digital life.

To create this [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) we had no choice other than to start from scratch and re-invent a lot because existing IT components are too centralized and often too inefficient (e.g. memory hungry).

# Ultra Efficient Decentralized Data Storage System

How is data stored

In most distributed systems, data is stored multiple times to guarantee redundancy. This leads to a lot of unnecessary overhead and is also not the most secure mechanism.

![alt_text](threefold__storage_system.png  )

### The “Space Algorithm” of storage

![alt_text](threefold__globe.png  )

The ThreeFold system uses dispersed storage algorithms and is very different in nature.

![alt_text](threefold__dispersed_storage.png  )

In a dispersed storage system the data gets dispersed in such a way that data will always be available even if 4 sites of the 20 (in this case) would not be available. Redundancy is the same as in the above example but the overhead is 20x less. It also has clear benefits from a security and efficiency perspective.

This has been originally invented for communication in space.

### How is this “Space Algorithm” used by the 3Bot

![alt_text](threefold__matrix.png  )

By nature, a [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) is stateless (has no data storage of its own). A [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) owns digital currency (ThreeFold_Token or TFT) which the [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) can use to reserve raw storage and compute resources on the grid.

![alt_text](threefold__3botflow.png  )

Each [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) has a unique capability to use this CPU and storage capacity from the different TFNodes in the TF Grid in a safe and reliable way. Data cannot be lost because of the above described dispersed storage algorithm.

A [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) can store a petabyte of information as long as enough [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s are available so the required resource can be reserved on the individual TFNodes. [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) is the only entity which has the required information and keys to make retrieval of the distributed data possible.

## BCDB

Our powerful Blockchain database.

The blockchain database has the following features:



*   Schemas (strongly typed)
*   3 types of indexing: key-based, full text search, and a full SQL compliant indexer
*   Multiple interfaces: REST, Redis, JavaScript client,, Python auto-generated client
*   Large and small objects can be stored (MBs to bytes)
*   All expected features from a blockchain are part of this product (e.g. immutability, verification, consensus, etc)
*   Encryption of data
*   We can guarantee full privacy for e.g. GDPR regulations (data is always 100% private, not shared)
*   ACLs = Access Control Lists
*   Multisignature
    *   For validation of new data
    *   For an update of data
    *   For invalidation (like delete, but data never really goes away – just becomes invalid)

Supported interfaces: WebDav, Redis, REST \

Depending on the type of required indexing, different support backend data storage or indexing systems are used. The main supported backend storage device is Zero-DB. 

## BCDB is the most efficient information retrieval system possible

![alt_text](threefold__library.png  )


In the current Internet, retrieving information happens in two ways:

**Centralized**



*   Based on a URL (a unique resource locator), which is typically rather long
*   A URL can only be used in a centralized context. It has been designed for that purpose. 
    *   _Example URL: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555434992-f1670f5e8fce?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=934&q=80_
*   Today +99% of all information is stored this way
*   You have to rely on the provider of the information (normally not the author) to deliver good uptime and enough connectivity to the Internet

**Distributed**

Blockchain or other distributed database



*   A long key e.g. 32 characters, or even 64
*   The data is distributed (sometimes replicated) over big areas – the data is not linked to the author but spread over a large area controlled by a blockchain or by a centralized application
*   The lookup process is typically slow – a special algorithm allows you to find the information in multiple steps, and there is no guarantee that the data is close to you when you need it.

In the suggested circular decentralized system there is only need for two numbers, to retrieve any information in the world. One number is to find which digital avatar to talk to, the other number is to find the information in the digital avatar of the data owner (can be a human person or other legal entity).



![alt_text](threefold__efficient_flexible_fast.png  )


Information can be a movie, for example, or a single piece of information like your email address. Each digital avatar is responsible for retrieving & reconstructing the information from the underlying IT capacity network (the nodes on a decentralized internet). This happens in a very secure way and the digital avatar is the only digital entity capable of re-assembling the information in such a way it makes sense again. This leads to very strong security.

**With only two numbers any information in the world can be addressed.**

This way of how to address information has far-reaching implications and can change the way how the Internet works.

## Indexing & Search Problem


![alt_text](threefold__new_library.png  )


A difficult problem in a fully decentralized system is how to index and search for information.

When an author (in a company or private context) creates content, he or she needs to define access rights to one or more circles. If giving read access to the universe circle, it basically means everyone can retrieve the information. Each piece of information also needs labels – these are labels you freely choose and do not necessarily have a meaning outside of your own environment.

There are some automatic labels like type of document, creation date, or location of creation (e.g. photo).

An author can define which part of the document (if not all) is available for indexation.

In the TF Grid there are aggregation providers which are deployed (paid for) and owned by a specific [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def). These aggregation providers list themselves into the aggregator blockchain (BCDB).

Aggregator Examples:



*   Big data analysis tool
*   Company employee directory
*   AI tools

End user examples



*   A football club directory
*   A city merchants organization

Each aggregator is basically a [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) who gets rights to query indexing and/or the information behind.

Each [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) (as instructed by their owners) needs to inform the required aggregators to index/access the information (in a broad sense: video, address details, documents, news as stored in the [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def). The [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) can use a combination of labels and circles to do so.



Example:



*   You create blog articles about food and want to be listed on an aggregator site of healthy food.
*   You found this aggregation site because of consulting the aggregator blockchain (of course there are nice tools available to make this user-friendly).
*   You can now instruct your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) to list all your relevant blog articles with labels “food” & “healthy” to that aggregator.
*   The aggregator will now receive instructions to index the information and list it in its own application to the intended audience.
*   The aggregator has the right to accept the information or not.
*   The aggregator can make a commercial business out of it and can decide to give part of the income to the original authors of the information using, for example, [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s. 

    Important to note, the information itself does not get stored on the aggregator site, only when creating the index. The required index information is being provided and used to create the index. This means that sensitive information will stay on the author [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def), and only fields relevant for indexing will go to the aggregator.


This system is super scalable because aggregator sites by themselves are limited in scope and do pre-sorting of information people look for (e.g. an Uber alternative only makes sense in a certain region – there is no point to have a global Uber aggregation site). It's even possible to create aggregators of aggregator sites ie. Sites which make it easy to query information over multiple aggregators.

# This leads to endless scalability 
The above-suggested architecture scales endlessly. Millions of [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s = digital avatars can work with millions of nodes. The nodes provide the capacity, the digital avatars are the brain. There is no bottleneck in this architecture.
