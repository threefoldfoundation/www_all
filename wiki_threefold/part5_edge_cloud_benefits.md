## The Benefits of Edge Computing

Edge computing come with specific benefits that are mandatory to make the next evolution in the IT industry work.  We have optimised the central model to such a degree that going forward the network, which connect central capacity to use cases in the field, the next bottleneck.  Edge computing is solving a number of challenges faced by real world situations by the following benefits:


### Speed

**Speed** is probably the most important benefit of edge computing, as there are plenty of use cases that require near real time computing.  


### Scalability

The scalability of edge computing also makes it incredibly [versatile](https://www.vxchnge.com/blog/edge-computing-use-cases). By partnering with local data centers further out on the edge, companies can easily target desirable markets without having to invest in expensive infrastructure expansion. Edge data centers allow them to service end users efficiently with little physical distance or latency. They also do not constrain companies with a heavy footprint, allowing them to nimbly shift to other markets should economic conditions change.


### Availability and Security

Traditional cloud computing architecture is by definition centralized, which makes it especially vulnerable to [distributed denial of service (DDoS)](https://www.vxchnge.com/blog/how-to-protect-data-centers-from-a-new-generation-of-ddos-attacks) attacks and power outages. Edge computing distributes processing, storage, and applications across a wide range of devices, nodes and data centers, which makes it difficult for any single disruption to take down the network which is why logically and geographically dispersed systems are often used for DDoS mitigation like in Content Delivery Networks (CDN)

By pushing everything to the cloud, you’re leaving your business open to ISP failures and cloud server downtime. Many mission critical operations like railroads and chemical plants won’t even use the cloud today. Their own server farms are the only way to guarantee uptime.


### Process optimisation

Another big benefit is process optimization. If self-driving cars were to use the cloud instead of the edge, they’d be pushing all the data they gather up to the cloud. But if the edge makes local decisions, the cloud may not need all that data immediately – or even at all.
