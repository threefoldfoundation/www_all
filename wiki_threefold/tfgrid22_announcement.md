**ThreeFold_Grid 2.2**

We're happy to announce our new release of TF Grid 2.2, which will go into production net (mainnet) next week. We would like to thank our community for testing this release since the beginning of summer.

The TF Grid 2.2 upgrade on mainnet will happen on Monday September 21.

> Allow us to remind you that this upgrade is a beta release of the TF Grid 2.2.

## What’s New on ThreeFold_Grid 2.2

### Introducing 3Bot: Your Virtual System Administrator

![](threefold__3botadmin.png  )

Your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) has been born. [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) is your virtual system administrator, it is your only way to manage your workloads on top of the TF Grid.

This gives you the best [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) decentralized experience, you don't have to use a central admin panel.
We are now launching a more user-friendly experience with the [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) that could be deployed and hosted online by using a [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) deployer on your web browser.

With a couple of clicks, you can get your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) will be activated and ready to use.

=======

- [**Deploy a hosted 3Bot on Mainnet**](http://deploy3bot.grid.tf)

For more advance people and developers, you can also deploy a [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) locally by using the local SDK.

#### New 3Bot Features

- Built-in Wallet
- Back up of your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) data
- Deployed Workloads Display.

Please visit our **[TF Grid 2.2 Manual](https://manual2.threefold.io/)** to read more about the [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) features.

### Capacity Pools

**[Capacity Pools](https://manual2.threefold.io/#/3bot_capacity_pools)** is an exciting feature made available on TF Grid 2.2.

It is a feature that enables you to reserve capacity on the grid to deploy your solutions.

In just a few clicks, you will be able to reserve IT capacity for your projects directly by creating multiple capacity pools and linking them to your project’s workload.

### FreeTFT is being replaced by Testnet TFT

On Monday, we will replace Free[TFT](threefold__threefold_token) with Testnet [TFT](threefold__threefold_token). There is a probability that we will use Free[TFT](threefold__threefold_token) again in the future, but for now, we will be using Testnet [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) on testnet. This means we can open up our testnet to a general audience, and enable people who want to test to do so by using a free currency (Testnet [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)) and start using the newest features.

**Benefits**

- All-in-one dashboard with all the features
- More exposure on our newer codes
- People don't have to pay for resources used on testnet
- You automatically receive some testnet [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) when you logged in to your deployed [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) on testnet for the first time.

On testnet, IT Capacity reservation is done by using Testnet [TFT](threefold__threefold_token).

You can request for free 1000 Testnet [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) for each request on this **[Testnet [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) Faucet](http://gettft.testnet.grid.tf)**

Please keep in mind that you can only receive Testnet [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) on a testnet [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) wallet. Please read our tutorial on how to get a testnet [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) wallet **[here](https://manual2.threefold.io/#/testnet_gettft)**.

If you would like to deploy a [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) on 2.2 mainnet, then the only accepted token on mainnet would be [TFT](threefold__threefold_token). if you would like to reserve capacity on mainnet with [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)A, you would need to do a [conversion from tfta to tft](threefold__tfta_to_tft.md).

### Introducing: ThreeFold NOW
