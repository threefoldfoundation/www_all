# What is the ThreeFold_Grid = P2P Cloud?

Originally the Internet was intended to be fully peer-to-peer and free. Today, that's not the case. People are turned into products, the centralized architecture is super unsustainable and the architecture became way too complex.

ThreeFold wants to restore this situation by expanding a peer-to-peer grid that protects its user data by design and that is sustainable for our planet, while delivering better performance and security than the current alternatives.

The TF Grid is bringing a real upgrade to our global Internet by bringing the foundation on top of which any Internet experience (or service) can be run in a decentralized way.

- Any application which can run on Linux (which is +- all) can run on top of the TF Grid with better performance and security.
- A decentralized, inclusive and collaborative network of nodes brought by independent parties.
- A dedicated digital currency called the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) (TFT) has been created to allow anyone to sell/buy this IT capacity (Storage, Compute, Network).

#### The ThreeFold_Grid is LIVE!

TF Grid is the largest peer-to-peer network of Internet (compute, storage and network) capacity in the world.

- +14,000 CPU cores
- +80,000,000 GB of online storage
- +21 countries

The capacity available on the TF Grid exceeds the sum of all IT capacity used by all blockchain projects (as at May 2020). May sound like a lot but it's still small compared to the massive centralized cloud providers.

The system is not yet distributed enough with +110 locations (as at October 2020) - yet this gives an idea of what is possible. With more farmers joining, the grid's potential will improve.

The TF Grid needs computers (servers) to function. Servers of all shapes and sizes can be added to the TF Grid by anyone, anywhere in the world. With [Zero-OS](threefold__zos), ThreeFold's open source operating system,runs on the servers to allow them to extend the grid. People who add these servers to the grid are called farmers. This is a fully decentralized process. Farmers download the [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) operating system and boot their servers ([3Node](threefold__3node)s)themselves. The [3Node](threefold__3node)s will register themselves in a database called the TF Directory and TF Grid users can then find the capacity they need to run their applications.

#### The Key Technology Components

#### The 3Node

[3Node](threefold__3node)s are set up and placed in numerous geographic locations essentially forming a network referred to as the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). Our open-source, stateless and lightweight operating system, [Zero-OS](threefold__zos), makes servers secure, trustworthy and super efficient.

Now, everyone can extend the grid with capacity. Also, any IT tech user can host their apps globally at much lower cost, and with improved security and performance, while being 100% decentralized.

#### The Digitial Twin

All your digital life run from one location owned and managed by you. Your digital avatar, all your needs (your own cloud, communication, socials, office tools, wallets, digital ID, and more) in 1 place.

Shift from an App centric to a Human centric digital world. With [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def), a global ecosystem for experience creation will become possible, but you remain the orchestrator of your digital life.

#### How Mature is the TF Grid = P2P Cloud?

- Our [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) is beta quality and is at its 2nd major release.
- The workloads can be registered using json format for our Smart Contract for IT layer.
- Experts can use any development language on the grid.
- We need more developers and copywriters to help expand the technology and knowledge base.

#### I am an expert how can I manage this cloud?

- [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) serves as your virtual system administrator (see http://sdk.threefold.io) on the TF Grid.
- It's a very powerful tool that allows you to automate & manage thousands of virtual workloads.
- Python language can be used to extend this tool and make it your own.
- This software is beta quality but usable for production. Be reminded that the workload itself is running on [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) and the Smart Contract for IT layer, which is production quality.
- Our newest version is 2.6, which has a nice UI and user-friendly wizards.
