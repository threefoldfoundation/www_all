# Commodity Tokens

Commodities are in general raw materials or good that are grown or mined. The commodities market is where they can be bought and sold, such as precious metals, gold, coffee beans, oil, grains, energy etc, IT capacity (like ThreeFold).

How can Blockchain Technology Benefit the Commodities Market?
Blockchain-based platforms and cryptocurrencies promise to improve the way the commodity-trading industry operates, addressing issues of trust, their inefficiencies and the complexity of transactions, which typically involve multiple parties. Blockchain technology allows a transparent record of complicated transactions, track goods, and reduce fraud, which seems to make it a natural fit for the commodity business.




The technology works as an encrypted and immutable database that does not need to be controlled by a central party and can be made accessible to all participants. Blockchain platforms can track commodities, record contractual agreements, and serve as a trusted register for trade documentation. Furthermore, Blockchain can digitize information, automatically execute contracts, and be used to standardize procedures, participants can manage and settle transactions reliably (on permissioned platforms settlement can be achieved in close to real time).
