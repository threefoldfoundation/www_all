# JumpScaleX Empowered

JumpscaleX is a cloud automation platform designed for scalability and fast development with a low memory footprint. It does that by providing very easy-to-use SALs (System Abstraction Layers) language which makes development cross-platform very efficient and unified, as well as easily adaptable to technology changes by exposing an abstract interface.

The main components of the jumpscale automation suite are:

### **SAL**
**SAL** System Abstraction Layer – it is a DSL (domain-specific language) for talking to a system. This allows the developer to use a user-friendly human-looking language when developing the life cycle management actors in Kosmos. This is the main bulk of jumpscale.


### **Clients**
**Clients** are user-friendly clients interfaces that help to connect to a multitude of systems (e.g. SSH, GitHub, FTP, Taiga, .. etc). 
*

### **Kosmos Actors**
**Kosmos Actors** Executing the intelligence required to get to full self-healing & self-driving.  Each actor is responsible for managing one or more services and it is the only location where configuration information resides. Think about them as virtual employees being responsible for a certain part of the universe which needs to be automated.
*   **Kosmos Shell: **Shell to interact with the actors.
*   **Config Manager:** A secure way to manage configuration instances. Anything saved to the file system is NaCl encrypted and only decrypted on the fly when accessed.
*   **Executors**: Jumpscale comes with its own executors that abstract working locally or remotely. Including: 
    *   SSH Executor (for remote execution)
    *   Local Executor (for local execution)
    *   Docker Executor (for executing on dockers)
    *   Z-Container Executor (happens over SSH & CoreX)

### **Startup Managers**
**Startup Managers**: Manage running processes in corex, tmux, etc.

### **tools**
**Tools** are there to automate your daily life as an expert IT person.

### **Schema & Data management**
 **Schema & Data management** layers the data strong typing, safety for your data models and all the tooling for data manipulation.

### **Configmanager**

The config manager in JSX provides an immediately-available security layer for configurations. It manages sensitive data, only decrypting during runtime when needed. It also has a recovery system built-in – built to facilitate creating, retrieving, deleting, importing, and exporting configurations.  \



### **Kosmos**

Kosmos is a new way to interface with all of JSX’s tools, SALs, clients, servers and builders. It gives full control over both the functionality and the instances created seamlessly, making building a deployment world and walking around all its components very simple. 


### **Builders**

A big part of deployments is managing built solutions or components, which JSX makes very simple. Using JSX builders, a developer can build, install, and sandbox their solution in no time. They can then create lists, which are lightweight metadata descriptions to be mounted in the filesystem.
