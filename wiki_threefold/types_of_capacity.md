# Types of ThreeFold_Grid Capacity

## the 3 types intro

### Certified Capacity

ThreeFold works together with hardware partners like HP to certify their hardware and to agree on a process how to bootstrap the nodes.

Each hardware vendor will have to sign a contract with ThreeFold Tech to guarantee the following

- the vendor will deploy the threefold secure keys which are specific per type of hardware and vendor in the bios of the servers.
- the bios will be configured to only allow secure boot
- the nodes will do a burn in test with ThreeFold certified test software
- where we register them against our blockchain
- this will allow our nodes to do secure boot, which means its impossible for farmers to gain access to the hardware or any of the workloads to run inside the hardware.
- to their best knowledge there are no backdoors in the equipment

### DIY Capacity

Anyone who connects a node (hardware box) to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) without any certification connects Do It Yourself (DIY) capacity.

Everyone who uses this capacity (which will be more cost effective than Certified Capacity) needs to realize that:

- the nodes don't use secure boot and as such there is no guarantee that the farmer does not use his IT hacking skills to try and see the workloads who are running in a node.
- we didn't certify the hardware together with a vendor. It could be that the hardware is not optimally designed / specked for our operating system.
- there are no guarantees for support or maintenance (guarantee) from a vendor's perspective.

- **Certified Hardware:**
  All hardware which is certified.
  With being certified the security of the hardware and the generated TF capacity is way higher.

- **DIY Hardware:**
  All Hardware which is not certified
