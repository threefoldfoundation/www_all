# What are ThreeFold_Tokens (TFT)?

The [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) is the currency of the new Internet. 

It is a decentralized digital currency that represents a unit of reservation of capacity (compute, storage) on the largest peer-to-peer network of capacity on earth. 

This new Internet is built by independent farmers, who dedicate hardware to provide storage and compute.

# What can I do with a TFT?

The purpose of the token is to pay for capacity or the utilization of capacity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). 

Example services you can buy with the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)

### Where do TFTs come from?

When farmers connect hardware to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__grid_what.md), they farm (mine) [TFT](threefold__threefold_token).

> [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) are created (minted) by TF Opensource Minting software as result of capacity being connected to the Internet, this process is called farming.
