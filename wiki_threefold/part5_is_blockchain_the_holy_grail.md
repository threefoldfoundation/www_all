## Is Blockchain the holy grail for decentralization?

![alt_text](threefold__chain.png  )


Blockchain has been painted as the holy grail of decentralization, it's a fantastic tool for certain use cases like smart contracts, digital ledger and money but we believe it's not the right tool for creating a platform where people can become owners of their digital destiny:

Why 

*   Non Efficient for decentralized apps and storage: Power hungry, Slow and Unscalable,  
inefficient in the usage of IT resources (too many copies of data, …).
*   Not decentralized ([taxonomy report](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/10/17/majority-cryptocurrency-centralized/),  [decentralization vs distributed](https://medium.com/nakamo-to/whats-the-difference-between-decentralized-and-distributed-1b8de5e7f5a4), [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/decentralized-data-why-blockchain-is-meaningless-and-trustless-is-everything-318fd14d3827), [blockgeeks](https://blockgeeks.com/decentralization-has-become-synonymous-with-blockchain-but-is-it-the-truth/))
*   Private blockchains do not exist ([hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/why-there-are-no-private-blockchains-in-nature-cb14b5fc1fb4), [coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/how-i-lost-my-faith-in-private-blockchains))
*   Greed has been [too much of a driving factor](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/15/blockchain-democracy-decentralisation-bitcoin-price-cryptocurrencies) on certain blockchains. 
*   Often misunderstood & hyped ([the verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17091766/blockchain-bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-meaning))

Many people believe Blockchain is the solution to decentralization, but the way how we use blockchains today is not realistic. Example today Ethereum blockchain is already 1 TB in size and it's only the beginning. The current way of using Blockchain technology is too inefficient (too many copies, power hungry, long lookup times, …) 

Understanding the graph from Bernard makes all of this very logical, because blockchain technologies are at the right side of the curve they are very reliable (resilient) but not efficient, and that is what we see today.

Basically it's the typical cycle, centralized system gets too efficient/centralized, people want something else they go to 100% distributed (blockchain) and now the world will hopefully look for more balance between the two and that is where believe the circular decentralized solution comes in.
