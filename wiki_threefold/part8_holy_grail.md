## The holy grail

The holy grail would be a self healing edge grid. Edge because of all the benefits Edge Computing brings to the user: Speed, Scalability, Reliability, Security, Versatility, and Process Optimization. Grid because it fulfills the distributed workload requirements a classic centralized cloud would normally be used for without the central nature and all its disadvantages.

Probably the most important part of the ideal solution is self healing. The biggest challenge of an Edge Computing environment is the dependency on local care: humans to maintain hardware and upgrade or fix software components. Self Healing needs to do the job here which means zero people can be involved. 

Only a self healing mechanism with zero-people involved, completely decentralised brings down the cost and provides more security to the environment and makes it highly scalable. See our specific [Whitepaper: Zero People IT Is The Future](threefold__zero_people_it_is_the_future.md) on this topic

Some of you may think the new blockchain based technologies like SIA, Filecoin or Somn may be the holy grail. But they are not.

Their implementations are in most cases to slow and thatâ€™s why it does not really make sense to use them for production purposes. Another downside is the complexity of the implementation caused by stitching together 3rd party technologies. Plus in many cases these blockchain based technologies are very early stage with beta implementations or even roadmap only type of technology.

The holy grail is something that has not been done before, it needs to be a versatile systems that is able to self manage.  The capacity should not be owned by a large global conglomerate - it should be owned by many and therefore it should have a commercial model where people individually can decide to partake in building this global edge solution and where there is a defined return of investments for those partakers.

There are a few groups of people trying to make a decentralised solution for this, owned by many, creating services for all.
