# ThreeFold Foundation History

This document has as purpose to provide some overview of the history of ThreeFold, we are now quite some years into the project.

We are a decentralized movement, ThreeFold Foundation has the purpose to promote the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) and movement. The Foundation wants to operate as a not for profit organization. Not for profit means that no shareholder has the intent to ever use any of the benefits (if any) as created in ThreeFold Foundation.

## History

In the earlier days of the ThreeFold there were multiple teams collaborating, but the 2 core teams where located in Dubai and Belgium.

- In Dubai we had: [ThreeFold_Dubai](threefold__threefold_dubai.md) = ThreeFold Foundation (\*), this company was owned by Adnan & Kristof.
- In Belgium we had:[Bettertoken](threefold__bettertoken.md), this company was owned by Kristof and Kristof's Incubator (Incubaid)

Adnan & Kristof started the ThreeFold idea (which is basically just a concept people can relate to or not) from above mentioned companies
and have always acted in their respective capacity as directors of these companies. This structure would later evolve into the ThreeFold Foundation as it is known today.

A small part of the original funding came from the fact that The ThreeFold Foundation has sold early capacity in form of ThreeFold Tokens. These buyers could use their [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) to buy IT capacity from [ThreeFold Dubai](threefold__threefold_dubai) or [BetterToken](threefold__bettertoken) BV until April 2020 or from the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) directly in a fully decentralized way starting May 2020.

The [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) is the result of many independent farmers using the open source technology which is now on https://github.com/threefoldtech.

Originally the technology used was created by 3 Companies: GreenIT Globe, [ThreeFold Dubai](threefold__threefold_dubai) & [ThreeFold Tech](threefold__tftech.md). The last two still actively participate in creation of tech components or content as used by all TF Farmers today.

(\*) a new organization: [ThreeFold Foundation VZW](threefold__threefold_vzw.md) has been created in Belgium to become the new structure for our Foundation. This is a company without shareholders and not controlled by any Individual or Company. Process is ongoing.

## Status (Aug 2020)

TF Foundation is investigating to create a legal funding structure in potentially multiple jurisdictions to be able to fundraise for the foundation and have government support for our token. In such a structure investors can provide funding for promoting capacity in the region, manage the digital currency, organize token funding/resell events, ... We are in conversations with multiple regions which are friendly towards digital currency or crypto projects.

If this project goes forward, this process will take a while before completion and could have an impact on the structure of the foundation.

## Genesis Pool

To kickstart the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) back in 2017 the foundation committed large amounts of capacity to the grid. This was called the [Genesis Pool](threefold__genesis_pool.md) and the tokens sold as mentioned could be used to use capacity from this pool and more.
