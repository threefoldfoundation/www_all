## TFGrid Fee

Note that the ThreeFold Foundation's sole purpose is to ensure the expansion of the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) and its ecosystem according to its vision and values. 

To fund these activities, a part of each transaction that pays [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s for cultivation and farming is going to the ThreeFold Foundation to finance the ThreeFold_Grid's expansion and to fund projects that are believed to bring a positive human or planet impact.

10% of Cultivation as well as of Farming are automatically transferred to a wallet that is owned by the ThreeFold Foundation.

The ThreeFold Foundation uses these proceeds to 

- reward staking (vesting pools): 5% in 2021, 2022 
- fund operational costs for [ThreeFold Foundation](threefold__threefold_foundation) (promotion of grid, marketing, development, engineering)
- sponsor community projects
- doing good projects using ThreeFold Grid technology.

The ThreeFold [Wisdom Council](threefold__wisdom_council) has to give budget approval as well approve spending to community projects and doing good projects.
