# Andreas Hartl - @andhartl
Passionate to change the Internet back to what is was intended to be - unbiased and assessable for all everywhere independent of race, color and religion. Grateful to work in a team that strives to make that change happen. Gathered experience in various tech companies over the years being in charge of local and international business. Working with people, building trustful relationships and empowering people whenever possible is a big part of my values.
