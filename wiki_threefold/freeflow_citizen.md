# I want to be a FreeFlow Citizen

All together ...

- We believe that the world is changing and we realize we have been brainwashed for most of our lives.
- We are a strong believer of [our values manifesto](https://www.freeflownation.org/manifesto.html).

### We are at service of

- The planet first
- Then our community ThreeFold
- And eventually ourselves

### We want to 

- Be guided by love, respect and courage, we will fight not to go in fear, greed or ego.
- Love and have respect for ourselves and others
- Understand our own shortcomings
- Appreciation and respect others effort
- Believe intuition is real and that it is not just knowledge or experience that counts
- Be 100% transparent even if that would be uncomfortable
- Be at service, we do this by becoming a member of one or more circles

### Do you want to become a ThreeFold Contributor (Ambassador) ?

- Make sure you have enough time available to be a Circle Member and you are not afraid to do things differently.
- Please realize that we are used to work in [red or orange organization structures](threefold__notes_on_reinventing_organizations.md), ThreeFold wants to work in the organization structure of the future called ["Teal Organization"](threefold__teal_organization_intro.md).
- You need to be willing to go the extra mile and always put the threefold mission & values first.
- Use the tools and processes as used by the larger community (FreeFlow circles, ...).

Please take this seriously, this is not wishful thinking or marketing, make sure you have really taken the time to read above and it resonates with you.
