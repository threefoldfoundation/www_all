## Private, Permissioned or Public Blockchains

The complexity around a blockchain comes from how the blockchain software is run.  The software can run in two different ways:  a small (or large) number of nodes controlled by one single entity (private blockchain) a person or a company, or a large (or small) number of nodes controlled by multiple entities (public) that do not know each other and where anyone interested to run a blockchain node can join.

By running blockchain software under the supervision of one entity (private, centralised) you can quite easily make sure the information stored in the blockchain (transactions) are not tempered with by only operating a small number of nodes and deploy them in very safe physical locations (private data-centers, vaults, basements of offices etc).  A private blockchain does not allow unknown entities to join and run the blockchain software.

A permissioned blockchain is operated by known entities such as stakeholders of a given industry. It is a mix of both private and public blockchain. In this type of blockchain network, a participant may not need permission to join the network but needs permission to transact with another network participant

A public blockchain allows anyone to join the blockchain operation and create a new blockchain node. The blockchain is run by multiple entities (decentralized, public) that have no relationship nor knowledge about each other 

For these three type of blockchains, there are different mechanisms to protect and guarantee the validity of transactions and make it tamper-proof.
