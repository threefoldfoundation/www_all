# Getting Started

## requirements

- we are still using gdrive for now (will be migrated later): get yourself an account on the incubaid gdrive (see Roel)
- get github account
- install 3bot-connect on your phone
- login into circles.threefold.me & forum.threefold.io

## Tools to get comfortable with

- circles_tools (important to be 100% up to date with this)

## TOP RULES

- never keep docs in your own folder on gdrive, always directly work on the folder of the company
- use _beta/_archive concept
- ONLY USE THE TOOLS AS MENTIONED IN circles_tools
- all info we create/update needs to be in one of the following locations (**NO WHERE ELSE PLEASE**)
    - a github of the org you're working for (this results in wiki, website, ...)
    - gdrive (see the links below)
    - forum (content for our generic audience if threefold)
    - circles tool (our project mgmt tool)
    - gitea (private git tool only for technical users, for nothing else)
    - cryptpad (ad hoc right now, will be on our grid very soon)
