# Hercules Compliance


Hercules compliance is a feature for Hercules Compute, Storage and Network.  The [smart contract for IT provisioning methodology](threefold__hercules_smart_contract.md) allows for for transparency and autitability of deployed IT workloads.

### Hercules compute compliance

Deployed [Hercules containers](threefold__hercules_containers.md) and [compute solutions](threefold__hercules_compute.md) are end to end described in the blockchain database and inspectable.

### Hercules storage compliance

Deployed Hercules storage solutions and kubernetes cluster are end to end described in the blockchain database and inspectable.


For compliance purposes Hercules Storage can be configured to have characteristics like:

- Immutability:  Write Once, Read Many-times (WORM)
- File versioning. Every update to a file leads to a new file version number.  Keep a number of (or all) older versions of the files to have complete traceability of what changed when, where and by whom.
- File activity logging.  Each and ever activity on files can be stored and made auditable to respective governance people, departments or authorities.
