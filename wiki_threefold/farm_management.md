# ThreeFold Farm Management & Setup

To create a Farm and manage it, you need a [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def). If you don't have one yet, head to the [Get a [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) section](threefold__3bot.md) of this manual before continuing.

In this section, we will help you get started with your farm:

* [Configure a Farm](threefold__farm_init.md)
* [Prepare a 3Node](threefold__3node_prepare.md)
* [Boot a 3Node over USB](threefold__boot_3node_usb.md)
* [Manage Farm & Nodes](threefold__3bot_farm_mgmt.md)
* [Manage your Farm wallet](threefold__configure_wallet.md)

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach us on the [Farming Section on the Forum](https://forum.Threefold.io/c/Threefold-grid-support/farmer-discussion).
