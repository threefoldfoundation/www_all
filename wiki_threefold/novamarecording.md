# November 12: November AMA Recording is Live!

On Tuesday we hosted an Ask Me Anything to answer some questions from the community!

We covered a range of topics:

- What are the target markets & the angles / ways in?
- Is the grid production-ready?
- Can we trust a decentralized grid? Is it secure?
- Where are things with the adoption of the grid?
- What are virtual data centers?
- Can you talk about the ThreeFold roadmap?
- What's going on with the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) (TFT)?
- Who is ThreeFold's big competition?
