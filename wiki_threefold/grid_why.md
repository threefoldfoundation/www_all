# The need for a New Internet Grid = P2P Cloud

The Internet is growing at an accelerated rate. To service this demand, a few large companies (Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, etc.) have built and continue to build supersized, power-hungry and centralized data centers. These data centers make up the majority of all Internet capacity available today.

Also, this Internet is very badly distributed, being located only in the most developed regions of this world. Despite being a human right, only half of the global population has internet access today. Therefore, we need an architecture that is scalable and affordable to all - something that is not the case today.

The Internet is expanding at such a rapid pace, that even the cloud giants can't cope with it. The creation of hyper-scale data centers takes time and cost in billions. And that doesn't even take into consideration all the externalities, as the internet consumes about 10% of global energy resources. Therefore, in an age of climate change, we need to find a more sustainable solution.

## The ThreeFold_Grid = P2P Cloud

The TF Grid is a peer-to-peer and autonomous Internet grid that provides game-changing performance and empowers new possibilities. It sets the foundation for a better Internet based on new principles:

- **Peer-to-Peer**: No intermediaries anymore. On the TF Grid, consumers go directly to the source. So, for example, if two friends call each other on a secure peer-to-peer application that lives on the TF Grid, only they will have data about the call, no one else â€“ not even us!
- **Decentralized**: The TF Grid's capacity is distributed across 20+ countries at launch. ThreeFold's decentralized architecture brings many benefits such as security, cost-efficiency, sustainability, and much more. The expansion and reach to regions that need Internet capacity the most will be incentivized and/or sponsored by the Foundation.
- **Autonomous**: Because it is self-sustainable and self-healing, the TF Grid is extremely resilient and enables data to be available even in the unlikely case a node on which data is stored goes down. The first of its kind, the TF Grid autonomous technology removes all the layers of complexity present in the current Internet.
- **Private & Secure**: By removing the need for human intervention, we eliminated many backdoors present in current architecture. Combined with the peer-to-peer and autonomous approach, users benefit from an incredibly private digital life.
- **Efficient**: Less is more. By reducing the layers of complexity, the TF Grid enables code and development up-to 10x faster.
- **Equal**: Internet access should be available to everyone. The TF Grid solutions position themselves as the most affordable on the market. As mentioned above, the expansion of the TF Grid to remote regions of our world will be incentivized and/or sponsored by the Foundation.
- **Sustainable**: The TF Grid is up-to 90% more sustainable than centralized alternatives on the market.
