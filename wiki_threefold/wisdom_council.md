![](threefold__owl.png  )

## Mission

- Financially support consciously aligned do-good projects and organizations.
- Protect the interests of the ThreeFold vision and mission.

9-12 members have following function:

- Protect the interests of the ThreeFold Foundation
- Approve [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) donations to doing good projects
- Agree on changes in protocol e.g. value of [CPR](threefold__cloud_production_rate) Reward


This process is based upon ancient leadership practices and modern social science techniques as a way to consider all perspectives of the Members in order to make decisions that are in the greatest interest of the Mission and for the good of all.

## Members

Wisdom Council Members are community leaders chosen by Founders Circle due to their honorable integrity and exemplary service related to The Mission. Structure and balance of Member Seats is based on one's personal role, strength, purpose, archetypes and other respectful characteristics.

We also call a Wisdom Council Member a ThreeFold Guardian.

## Responsibility

Based upon the ageless principles of the Wisdom Council equation, Members will converge (online or live when possible) to discuss and vote upon the distribution of funds from ThreeFold Foundation to pre-approved and/or pre-selected do-good projects and organizations.

## Approve Grants

In order to make balanced, fair and effective decisions regarding ThreeFold Foundation funds distribution, ThreeFold Foundation has adopted the Wisdom Council system as a resource model of harmonious communication

ThreeFold Foundation receives through the blockchain a small percentage of all cloud capacity farmed and sold on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid). 

These proceeds are used to further develop the ThreeFold Movement and later to benefit planetary do-good projects.

## Process

ThreeFold Foundation prepares all the decisions to be taken by the Wisdom Council.
Eventually, voting happens using blockchain technology and is done by all Wisdom Council members.
