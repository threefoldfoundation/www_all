# It feels too much, can this really be done?

We believe this is very achievable and in fact we are already well on the way to executing on this mission. Today we already have more capacity online compared to the sum of all other blockchain projects.

We are pragmatic and our motto is to do more with less effort. Our technology allows us to be very efficient and our effort to create these services is maybe upto 100 times easier than if we would have to build these services from scratch.

We need more funding though, we are self funded today (by means of our community) and have enough to continue but we feel we can go faster and enable more companies to become part of our movement.

One of our keys to success are our partnerships and we are very grateful that they want to support our mission.
