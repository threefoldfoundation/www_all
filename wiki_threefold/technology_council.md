# Threefold Technology Council

Technology guardians are the members of the threefold technology council.

Together they take the required technology decisions for the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) Related day2day technology decisions.

## What is it

- Group of people who evaluate to their best abilities the technology as needs to be deployed in the grid.
- Some examples of decisions which need to be taken
  - Approve code releases.
  - Sign the deployment of the code, so no code can be deployed for production purposes before majority signs.
  - Approve new development projects when funded by the ThreeFold foundation
  - Approve for standards/procedures/… as could be relevant for the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) technology stack or operations
  - ...

## Council

They don’t take being a member of this council lightly, it's a serious responsibility.

## Fit for duty requirements

- They really really believe that what is being developed for the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) is super important for the planet in an attempt to help raise awareness (consciousness), but in this case for the digital world (internet). You don’t look at this like some technical gimmick but a real necessity.
- There is no ego involved by being a guardian.
  - We realize our own reason to be a guardian is to be at the service of the threefold community and the planet.
- Work on self-development
  - Realize we know nothing and are nothing but will always work in the best interest of the planet. The more we learn the less we know.
  - Don’t blame others, change starts with ourselves.
  - We see the benefit of self-improvement work e.g. meditation, self-reflection, sessions with energy healer / spiritual coach, …
- Not addicted to any substance
- We really believe the values as described on our freeflow nation.
  - [https://freeflownation.org/manifesto.html](https://freeflownation.org/manifesto.html)
  - We know them, we understand them, we agree with them
- If we have a shortcoming in one of the above we are not afraid to be open about it and express our desire to improve on it.
- Technical
  - We are expert for at least 50% of the code as used in TF Grid.
  - We are not shy to read code.
  - We have deep understanding of how it all works.
- Willing to be a Technology Guardian for at least 2 years starting your submission.

## Our character

We will do everything we can to protect the technical sanity of the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) core technologies.

We evaluate based on

- Security
- Scalability
- Decentralization
- Sustainability

## Remuneration

- not at this time

<!-- ## Voting (technical details can change)

- Default voting rights: 66% majority required
  - approve code as used for e.g. minting operation or any other grid operation
  - approve software release (upgrade of grid software, check that the right auditors have been used to make sure the software is ok, check the testing cycles)
- Each guardian can initiate a voting round
- Each guardian has a voting account on [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain).
- A voting wallet is co-owned by each member of the grid council.
- Each vote is a transaction prepared (sending 1 TFT from voting wallet to voting wallet) with the voting ID and voting hash (hash is a unique key guaranteeing the validity of the content of the voting request) as part of the transaction description. This makes sure that everyone with 100% certainty agrees on the voting request and signs the transaction.
- Transactions can only happen if at least 5 of the 7 people sign.
- during 2020, this happens still on rather informal basis. -->
