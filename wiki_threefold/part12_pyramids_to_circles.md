## From Pyramids To Circles

![alt_text](threefold__you_at_center.png  )

Today every service on the internet is fully centralized. As discussed earlier we have become a product.

The [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) system allows a different mechanism to use those kinds of services.

We call this mechanism **FreeFlow Circles**.

Our personal [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) acts as our digital self, it acts like our avatar. This [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) owns all our information and can act on our behalf. Our personal digital cell is at the center of our FreeFlow Circles.

All of the commonly used applications listed in the pyramid on the left of this graphic are neither in line with the FreeFlow Nation values nor are they good for our World. Our personal [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) has the capability to eventually become a credible alternative to all these functions.

**Some examples of services which can run in a personal [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) (your digital self).
**

- You own your identity and can share in a controlled way
- You publish your own information (like facebook, Wikipedia, …)
- You are your own bank (wallet, exchange, different fiat & digital currencies, gold)
- You have access to your own private browser which runs next to your cell and allows you to browse the internet in all privacy without censorship.
- You have access to a decentralized video/audio conferencing system which cannot be blocked and is much more efficient (faster, fewer resources used).
- You can offer your services to anyone in the world and have equal chances to do so.
- You can buy services from anyone and localized to your situation (taxis, hotels, restaurants, …)
