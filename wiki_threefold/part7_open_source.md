## overview of some components

We do realize it is still very difficult today based on the repos alone to get started. The documentation is by no means complete and it still requires a lot of knowledge to get started without help.

### Zero-OS

- [Zero-OS](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos): our low level operating system
- [0-fs](https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-fs): The storage layer of our container technology (can also be used in VM's)
- [0-initramfs](https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-initramfs): All that is needed to build the Zero-OS-kernel and initramfs to start root filesystem
- [0-bootstrap](https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-bootstrap): This web service provides dynamic construction of iPXE scripts for booting and bootstrapping [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) kernel images
- [0-hub](https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-hub): Everything needed to serve, upload, merge, and manage flists, as well as convert docker images to flists
- [core-X](https://github.com/threefoldtech/corex): Process manager for containers
- [0-db](https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-db): A super fast and efficient key-value store redis-protocol with fast indexing
- [0-flist](https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-flist): Tool to create and manage flists. The flist file format creates a small file with enough information to make a complete filesystem available without the data payload itself
- [flist-builder](https://github.com/threefoldtech/flist-builder-config): autobuilder config template
- [bus for interprocess communication](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zbus)
