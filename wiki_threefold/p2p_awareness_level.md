# peer2peer awareness level

![](threefold__levels.png  )

## Intro

We don't believe in pyramids (stars), we believe in spheres (circles) where everyone has a very important role to play.
Freedom comes with a lot of responsibility. Many of us are still stuck in the hierarchical (fear) based way of working. Many want to go higher up and be able to make decisions.
We strongly don't agree with this way of working, there is no “up”. Everyone is the center of their circle.
By giving respect to others and being transparent in your plans and work others will follow you based on the quality of your work, not based on the level you have in an organization. In our world, everyone is "a boss" but this needs to be deserved.

We believe everyone needs to work together in a truly peaceful way and empower each other to co-create and make the chosen joint dream reality.

Not everyone is on the same capability level in his/her career. We have defined some levels which can help us to work together and think about ways to grow on a professional and personal level. We believe this will help us to grow and become more effective as an organization and community. 

The first thing which needs to happen is that we agree with these capability levels and see the need to make progress in them. In case you don't feel these levels are ok for you it probably means another type of organization is better for you to work with.

## our levels

- Pup: young, need to learn a lot, passionate, wants to grow
- Wolf: ambitious, still a little bit careless, still need to learn, but already very efficient
- Elephant: protector of the others, example, can learn & guide others, strong & reliable
- Dolphin: smart = wisdom & experience, an expert in less = more, always thinks before doing, can teach others
- Eagle: the top, can fly anywhere, can do anything, has lots of freedom

Let's be clear: we all make mistakes, that's perfectly ok, that's the way how we learn. The focus is on a personal commitment to demonstrable growth. This also implies that no-one should want to stay in the pup level.

We are an ambitious startup and we can't build our dreams with only pups. We'll need wolves, elephants, and dolphins.

We also consider the personal growth to be very important, it's not just about business and technology.

We have created [a test which can potentially help you to define your level](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ToPlNUr_R2GeN_PTyVSdb0ITXm6jjRzD6FAw6N1FpVE/edit#gid=738883030). Feedback very welcome, please give us advice how to make changes: kristof@incubaid.com 

### Pup

- Requirements
	- ambitious
	- positive energy
	- willing to learn a lot
	- willing to grow also in personal development (see personal development elements below)
	- intelligent
- should realize that in a FreeFlow organization everyone will get a lot of freedom but will need to be responsible and be 100% transparent.
- should understand and know about the values of the organization/community they are working in.
- should aspire to become a wolf in a maximum of 2 years.

If any of the following applies to you then you are still a pup in [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) collaboration level.

- I want to be a boss or believe have all freedom means:
	- *I like to be trusted and work on myself, people need to trust me, I get things done, I believe that having to be transparent about what I will focus on and getting feedback is not required*.
- When things go wrong or I don't feel well I believe its mainly because of issues which are external to myself e.g. my boss, another person, the company, ... its hard for me to look at myself as source of issues. In a real [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) organization you can always escalate in a nice way in your circle, let others know issues you see, information you don't have, tell about items which block you so you can be successful and most important let others know what you are trying to achieve and why and be welcoming for feedback.
- I believe everything written in [threefold contribution section](threefold__peer2peer_collaboration.md) is a little over the top, I don't really buy into to it, but heck I want this job and its cool what we do so I play along.

### Wolf

> Some will believe why is all of this needed, why can I just not be trusted.<BR>
> I am sure your company does trust you or you would not be working there.<BR>
> You are not working for a pyramid company, this means full transparency and some discipline is needed to allow [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) collaboration to function. <BR>

If any of the following applies to you then you are still a wolf in [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) collaboration level.

- I have hard time to understand what is good enough. Maybe I did not take enough time to understand enough about the space I am working on, or maybe I am too quickly happy about what I deliver, or maybe I have a hard time to put myself in the situation my "customer" is in.
- I am bad in 20-80% rule, I can so easily loose time on things which are not important.
- I want to own stories, but I can't do what the requirements are.
- I think everything is constantly changing, but maybe I just didn't or don't understand the bigger picture, but maybe I don't take enough time to read and really understand what the bigger picture is. Maybe I need to understand that the big picture is the same but maybe we are in the forest and need to find our way around rivers, trees, ... to get to the destination, in the forest this might look as changes.
- I refuse to use the tools which are important to work in a [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) way (git, markdown, ...). I don't understand why this is needed. Maybe it is really too hard for me and I don't need it in my job that much but then I need to accept I cannot own a story and I will ask others to help me to use the tools so I can be transparent about my progress & purpose.
- I keep on reinvesting stuff, rather than first really try to understand what is there already, see if I can improve or ask questions where not understood. I rather create new and push my way.

## Personal Development

We believe it's super important that people work on their own development, quite some information has been written about this already, we hope this and other information in this wiki will give you the required inspiration.

Of course, this is only the starting point, growing into your own path is a life mission.
