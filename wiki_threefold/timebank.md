# Beliive (TimeBank)

![](https://www.consciousinternet.org/threefold/info/projects/beliive/beliive.png)

*The Beliive* is a community where people can exchange experiences and services using time as the only currency. When the money economy is failing at giving us a way to exchange our value independently of the circumstances, Beliive decided to create a complimentary economy based on an abundant resource available to everyone equally – time.

### Purpose

Our vision is to be a movement that rethinks and rebuilds the value of money, the value of time, and the way we collaborate with each other. We aim to provide a platform where low-income and unemployed people can exchange their time (hours) of volunteering for knowledge and skills.

### Status Today

With 200,000 members to-date, Beliive is the world’s largest time bank. Beliive already has an open API and a web widget that can integrate our time banking technology with different platforms and systems. Soon our time credits will use blockchain technology.
