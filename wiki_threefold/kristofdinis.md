# June 15: Interview with Dinis Guarda

Over the weekend, our co-founder Kristof had the chance to sit down with Dinis Guarda â€“ author, speaker, serial entrepreneur, advisor and experienced CEO who is focused on sustainable innovation, blockchain, fintech, AI, and new emerging business models.

The interview is quite thorough, perhaps a good one to have in the background on this fine Monday.

Topics covered include: Kristof's background, about ThreeFold, the role of blockchain, digital twins, farmers, how data is created and shared on the new peer-to-peer internet, and vision for the present and future.

We hope you enjoy!
