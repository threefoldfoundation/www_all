ThreeFold co-founder Weynand Kuijpers introduces the 3SDK Beta. This session gets quite technical, but is super relevant for anyone who wishes to understand how to deploy workloads on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

In this session, Weynand covers the following:

- How to get started – wallet, possibilities, & overview of 3SDK
- How to deploy an ubuntu container (or any other docker app) on the TF Grid
- How to choose a node on which to deploy
- How to verify if container was deployed
