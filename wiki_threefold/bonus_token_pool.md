# Bonus Token Pool System

![](threefold__bonus.png  )

In non circular organizations (companies) typically a share option pool is being used. We believe this is super hard to do in a new circular economy. 
This document describes an alternative way

> REMARK: this has not been implemented yet, its is not easy to legally and taxwise to get this to work, we are still trying though because we believe in the mechanism. <BR>
> Even if it wouldn't work in its current form, we will try to re-use large parts of this document.

## short description

* Each contributor earns points per month based on
    * % of time working for the project 
    * [P2P awareness level](threefold__p2p_awareness_level.md): nr between 1-5
    * Experience level nr: nr between 1-5
    * Country Index: where person lives (europe=1, egypt=0.3, ...), is to relate to cost of living
* Whenever this program starts founders start with a benefit
    * Founders start with X nr of years/months benefit when starting
* Each month a contributor get’s points as follows
    * ```%working time x P2PAwareness x experience_level x country index```
* When company gets to an exit
    * After giving every investor first their money back (1x liquidation preference)
    * the remaining profit/proceeds get split over the investors & founders following a predefined percentage ```split_percentage```

### Example:

* As founder I have 3 years of initial benefit at experience level 4 and P2PAwareness 4
means I start with ```100% * 4 * 4 * 3 *12 * 1 = 576 points```
* The company will exit after 3 years from now.
* If I stay on the same levels this gives me an additional 576 points.
* A developer only worked 2 years for the company. P2PAwareness=2, experience=2, country Europe:  ```100%*2*2*2*12*1=96 points```

* At exit:
    * Founder = 		1152 points
    * Developer = 		96 points
    * Rest of team = 	6000 points

* Means 
    * Founder gets 1152/7248 = 16% of proceeds
    * Developer gets 96/7248 = 1.3% of proceeds

    * If company would be worth e.g. 60m EUR at exit & 10m eur funding went in (with interest)
    * if agreed split_percentage would be 50%

* result
    * Founder gets ```16% * 50%* 50m EUR = 4m EUR```
    * Developer gets ```1.3% * 50%* 50m EUR = 0,32m EUR ```

> In the above simulation it's just calculated for 1 company. In reality the Bonus Token Pool owns [TFT](threefold__threefold_token), shares in multiple companies, and as value goes up and liquidity has been achieved it will allow people to change their Bonus Token to a chosen other digital currency (can be USD backed token of course).

## More Details

### For who?

- only for contributors to circles which are not business development.
- business developers (networkers, advocates have other remuneration systems = the matchmakers system)

### Why

* Sharing the value creation
* Ensuring loyalty & sustainability
* More fair for everyone involved
* Promote Teamwork = common goals for everyone
* A living mechanism (flexibility)
* Be more fair and easy to manage compared to classic stock option plans.
* Allow for someone not to be functioning at 200% all the time, maybe some less productive period can & should be possible.

### Principles

* Fairness:
    * Considering where you live (for base salary), PPI (Purchasing Parity Index), we call it country index
* Objectivity
* Respect to sharing values, desire to promote loyalty
* Motivated for the long haul - seniority effect
* Respect for human energy = be efficient for providing value to our community and our investors in the broadest sense of the word..

# The Bonus Token

* Bonus is collected by a point system,
    * Points are given on a quarterly basis
* We call each point a BonusToken (will eventually be registered on a blockchain)
* Goal is to keep it very simple yet as fair as possible

## How

* Everyone can earn points per month
* Points are calculated as follows
    * P2PAwareness x % %workingtime x country_index x experience_level
* The experience_level is defined by the remuneration committee at hiring but also later on.

### experience_level

**The remuneration committee** does not take the following parameters in consideration**

* Seniority: how long are you working for one of our companies
* Age
* Title
* Gender
* Location (where do you live/work)

This is very different compared to a hierarchical company.

Its is based on

- experience build up 
- education (but not related to university e.g. self education works as well)
- how many years has a person been active this in this domain
- how efficient will the person be to execute the tasks/job at hand

**The remuneration committee evaluation will be based upon:**

* experience_level is rewarded at hiring time and are between 1 and 5.

* At Hiring
    * Based on experience and predicted level for the future 
* After Hiring
    * Once a year at least, the remuneration committee will review if the experience_level is in line with expectations.
    * The experience_level is a combination of many parameters some examples
        * Some extra special efforts done which had benefit for our group
        * Projects delivered
        * Product created and important for the company (ownership)

* The experience_level can be changed by the remuneration committee if that would be required. Of course proper communication happens with the contributor.

**Who is part of the remuneration committee**

Is different per organization. Please ask the company you work for.

**Experience Level Score**

* 1: the default (most people will be here)
* 2: senior experience, very good in job
* 3: Super experience, few can do what you do.
* 4: exceptional, from experience & contribution level. Super strategic for the company.
* 5: absolutely exceptional, almost no-one can be here.

### Peer-2-Peer Awareness Level = P2PAwareness

It has to do with capabilities we achieve in line of working with a circle based organization.

Levels can be found in:

[Peer2Peer Awareness Level](threefold__p2p_awareness_level.md)

* Pup = 1
* Wolf = 2
* Elephant = 4
* Dolphin = 5
* Eagle = NA today


At least once a year this needs to be reviewed, but more is better.

### How to deal with history

When the bonus token plan starts the remuneration committee looks at history and starts with a pre-set amount of points.

Max nr of months = 48 to take into consideration

## How do we want to use a blockchain

These points will be registered on a blockchain & will be a separate token in your wallet.

How (detailed, not important to understand now):

* Each quarter people get their collected tokens = BonusTokens in their wallet.
* Tokens can be exchanged on Decentralized Exchange.
* For each exit the value of the bonus pool goes up.
* The Bonus Pool org will sell tokens at the following price
    * Value of pool / nr of tokens
* Foundation Pool Value = sum of all assets which are liquid
    * E.g. Liquid tokens e.g. [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)
    * E.g. Money e.g. as result of exit of a company
    * E.g. Gold

* Once people sold tokens to Bonus Pool, the tokens get destroyed, so fewer tokens available to distribute when people step out.


### Exit value at any time = 

Value of bonus pool at start = 0$

At any time there is an exit the value is added to the bonus pool.

The bonus pool is combination of 

* cash e.g. exit of a company
* tokens e.g. TFT’s in liquid form
* Shares of other public company's e.g. if we did an IPO

The value of a BonusToken is

* total value pool/nr of BonusToken in pool

Everyone can sell BonusTokens to the pool at any point in time at the calculated value above, if enough liquidities are available.

**Remark:**

* The pool keeps on rising in value over time e.g. share on IPO, [TFT](threefold__threefold_token), sell 1 more company…
* So Bonus Tokens can/will go up in value in relation to value created.
* Everyone chooses when to sell Bonus Tokens or not, it's basically a transaction on our own decentralized exchange from BonusToken to GoldToken.
