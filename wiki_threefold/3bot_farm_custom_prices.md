# 3bot Farm price management

The explorer sets global default prices for CU, SU, IPv4U that are applied on each farm and can be found on the [explorer](https://explorer.threefold.io), but also allowing full control on farm prices and allowing deals between farmers and other grid users opens lots of potential as well.

Here  in the farm management interface, we can see multiple options

- Set farm price: allows setting global price on the farm to be used for all of the deployments on that farm (overriding the explorer prices)

- Add deal button: allows creating special deals between the farmer and another [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)

 and also you can edit and change the deals from the user interface.
