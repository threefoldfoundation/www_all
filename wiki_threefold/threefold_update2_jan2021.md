# ThreeFold's 2021 Looking Ahead Community Update

![](threefold__update2021lookahead.png  )

We came a long way since we started the project almost 3 years ago.

We didn't talk that much but we created a lot of value. Our ThreeFold Cloud is a super-capable edge cloud which can be used by anyone to host their workloads. See more info below. Capacity is available in 23 countries and growing. Our partnership funnel is running like crazy. We can expect great things this year!

## 2021 is the year of our breakthrough

Here's a look at what's coming:

### Grid 2.5 on production net!

The 2.4 release is evolving to our 2.5 release over the next 1-2 months.
Grid 2.5 will be released on production net as well and will be usable for production workloads.

Some new features include:

- Lots of testing (bug fixes) & integration of community feedback
- A plugin for [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), a great way how to automate your IT end2end with seamless integration of all [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) capabilities.
- We will be adding [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) support later on.
- Public accessible monitoring features for [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) with plugin to import data in eVDC hosted [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) monitoring system.

### Grid Expansion

In 2021, we have **ambitious goals around the expansion of the TF Grid**. We are aiming for +100 new locations and +10,000 new nodes by the end of the year. We expect demand for ThreeFold capacity to rise considerably throughout the year.

We will grow the grid together with our partners and aim to bring more than 100 of their use cases live on the grid.

We will be announcing some [3Node](threefold__3node) channel partnerships soon, which will make it easier for everyone in the world to become a farmer and expand the TF Grid. The [3Node](threefold__3node)s are nodes which run our operating system [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) and are connected by our capacity providers on the TF Grid, called farmers.

### Token Utilization Acceleration

The [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) represents IT capacity on the TF Grid, which we aim to make the biggest network of IT capacity in the world.

IT Capacity (cloud) is already a trillion $ market. A lot of growth is predicted because the internet is becoming more important than ever to fulfill the requirements of our digital lives.

Many use cases require capacity to be at the edge of the network. We want to be the market leader in this segment.

The [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) price has a minimum price of 0.1 USD on the TF Grid. This is not reflected on some public exchanges which we see as an opportunity for our community (discount on capacity).

We are working to get more visibility for our token and show the world the intrinsic value as the commercial medium of our TF Grid. See in the "ThreeFold_Token ([TFT](threefold__threefold_token)) moved to Stellar" section above for the steps we are planning to take to drive adoption of the [TFT](threefold__threefold_token).

### Driving meaningful usage of the ThreeFold_Grid

#### edge Virtual Data Center (eVDC)Â 

The eVDC presents a familiar interface for anyone working with Kubernetes and Docker containerization tools.

Some benefits:

- _convenience_: your kubernetes environment available in minutes anywhere in the world (in relation TF Grid availability)
- _unlimited scaleability_: thanks to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) and the [Zero-OS](threefold__zos)
- _quantum safe storage_: the safest way how to store data over multiple locations
- _security & privacy_: thanks to our network wall and planetary network capabilities
- _competitive pricing_: thanks to our farming approach and technology capabilities
- _locality/sovereignity_: host your apps and data in a location close to you (in your country) which results in supporting your region, compliance to regulations and more performance for your users

Alongside eVDC will be ThreeFold Now Community Tools, a marketplace of installable tools for online communities. With eVDC, ThreeFold brings **the tools global developer communities already know and love**, but in a **much more advanced environment** than what's available on the market.

#### Planetary File System, a new interface to our Quantum Safe Storage

The main breakthrough is in regards to being able to present a filesystem as the interface to the storage solution. This makes it compatible with a large number of protocols and API's that can now interact with the ThreeFold Quantumsafe and unbreakable storage solution as with any other (local or remote) filesytem.

PLanetary File System will be a quantum safe storage solution that will enable anyone to store their data anywhere on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid).

Some benefits:

- _quantum safe_: unbreakable and unhackable solution with automatic recovery and protection mechanism.
- _convenience_: any interface and use case can be hosted on top of Planetary FS.
- _unlimited scalability_: Choose as many locations as you want on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) and define redundancy for your storage with geo cashing.
- _competitive pricing_: thanks to our farming approach and technology capabilities.
- _locality/sovereignty_: host your apps and data in a location close to you (in your country) which results in supporting your region, compliance to regulations and more performance for your users.

#### Digital Twin, the ultimate end-user experience

Digital Twin is **the ultimate end-user product** (beta version planned for later in Q1) that will live on the TF Grid and allow you to **re-imagine and take back the ownership of your digital life**.

Some benefits:

- _sovereignty_: own 100% of your digital life - communication, socials, office, cloud, and much more in a fully peer-to-peer environment. You decided with who you share your data and can revoke access at anytime. Data remains stored where you decide and 100% owned by only you. Not even ThreeFold would be able to access it.
- _convenience_: all your digital life in one place with a unique profile/ digital ID.
- _security & privacy_: completely end-to-end encrypted network between users and nodes. This solution is GDPR compliant by nature as now users decide on where to store and with whom to share their data.
- _experience_: enter a digital world designed with less is more. no advertising. only what you need.
- _limitless possibilities_: we will create a protocol for any technical person to design their digital twin and digital life as they want.

Digital Twin will be **the product that will enable end-users to break away from the centralized entities** who own and manipulate their digital lives such as Google, Facebook & Amazon!

### Partnerships

2021 will be a big year for the evolution of ThreeFold partnerships in the blockchain space and way beyond. This will contribute to significant grid usage as well.

#### Blockchain ecosystem evolution

We intend to onboard and serve all the other remaining Blockchain protocols this year, as well as multiple DeFi, Gaming, and social dApps with our peer-to-peer compute, storage and our developer tools. We will **empower them** with a Kubernetes-focused product, The ThreeFold eVDC, for a more resilient, fast, and decentralized, cloud-native infrastructure.

We also realized that ThreeFold holds the technology to solve the interoperability issue of the blockchain Industry. This is a huge pain-killer for the Industry and holds the premise to connect all blockchains together. We're **on track to build the largest Blockchain ecosystem in the space**.

#### Students taking action on climate

The **[Climate Action Project](https://www.climate-action.info)** believes that young people have the potential to solve real-world problems and take meaningful actions. As part of the project, students explore, discuss, create, and share findings, learn from global peers, come up with solutions and create prototypes, and leverage governments, partners, press, and public figures to **take action on climate change**.

ThreeFold believes one of the most powerful aspects of the internet is education. We will be collaborating with the incredible Climate Action Project on **an educational toolset for their students** which will include video conferencing, office tools, a wikipedia-style knowledge base, a video database, and more. With ThreeFold technology, students can connect peer-to-peer and **ensure their data is safe, secure, and private**.

#### Fair Trade moving to Fair Data

In 2018, we signed a partnership with **Solidaridad**, the **largest supply chain company in the world**, most famous for its trademark 'Fair Trade.' Now that our technology is coming to life for a wider audience, we are stepping into the light together to build solutions on the grid that will **enhance the lives of tens of thousands of smallholder (agricultural) farmers** in Africa with the next evolution of 'Fair Trade', 'Fair Data'.

This partnership will bring forward **a farmers movement for fairness in the production and trade in commodities and associated data**, based on the principles of Fair Participation, Fair Share, Fair Value and Fair Voice in the entire value chain. Fair Data will provide the framework for an alternative data economy that works for smallholder farmers and we are very excited to drive this collaboration forward this upcoming year.

#### Powering conscious cities

The **EarthHealth Partnership**, a conscious city initiative based out of the UK. Their aim is to **create communities** of investors, municipalities, landlords, and tenants **to become a self-sustaining and truly smart city**. We are architecting a solution with them that will create data processing and storage capabilities sitting physically next to solar electricity generators. This will help to create **create autonomous communities** in regards to electrical needs, local data processing, and storage capabilities building a city-wide platform on which municipalities, local entrepreneurs, and eventually **citizens can run applications servicing their digital needs**.

### New focused websites & wikis

Coming soon, you will see a much more **tailored and focused web presence** from ThreeFold. In 2020, as our technology evolved and we had countless conversations with partners, investors, and others, we refined and segmented our story internally to better reach our targeted audiences. So you will see that reflected in upcoming materials.
