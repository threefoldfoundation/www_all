## Different types of organizations:

- Red = gang, wolfpack - Alpha dominates, division of labor
- Amber = Army, church - everyone whears a uniform - does their job
- Orange = machine, measure everything, test performance (most used organization structure today)

## Now Teal = new organization structure

### 3 Breakthroughs:  

All Teal organizations are based on:

1. Self-management. Teal organizations have found the key to upgrading their structures from hierarchical, bureaucratic pyramids to powerful and fluid systems of distributed authority and collective intelligence.
1. Wholeness.  Organizations have always been places that encourage people to show up with a narrow “professional” self. Teal organizations have developed a consistent set of practices that invite us to drop the mask, reclaim our inner wholeness, and bring all of who we are to work.
1. Evolutionary purpose.  Teal organizations are seen as having a life and a sense of direction of their own. Instead of trying to predict and control the future, members of the organization are invited to listen and understand what the organization is drawn to become, where it naturally wants to go.
