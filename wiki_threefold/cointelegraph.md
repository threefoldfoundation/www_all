# June 4: Coverage on Cointelegraph

![](threefold__cointelegraph.png  )

We received some coverage in Cointelegraph yesterday pertaining to our project and our partnership with DigiByte and others.

It's a good read, it was honest, and it presented some questions. (By the way, there's a forum conversation going on to answer those questions.)
