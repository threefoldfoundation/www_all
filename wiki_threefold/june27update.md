# June 27: Important ThreeFold Tech MOU

Good morning everyone, the last weeks we got overwhelmed, too many things happening, we will organize an update zoom call very soon.

Just to mention one thing, yesterday our tech company signed an MOU with a UK partner for delivering ThreeFold farming capacity for some UK cities. This farming capacity (IT capacity) will be integrated with a renewable energy project, already many thousands of solar panels are deployed in the field as part of this project.

A big fundraising campaign is happening for the next phase of this project. This project will be a fantastic proof of concept to show how cities can deploy their own sovereign internet with benefits like privacy, boost for local economy, less energy usage, integration with IoT projects, disaster recovery scenarios (this internet can never break down), personal internet freedom ... We are very grateful for our UK partner to make this possible.
