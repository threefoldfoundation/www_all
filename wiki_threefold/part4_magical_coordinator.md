## Magical Coordinator

### Requirements to let actor based management work

* Less complexity

* State only with the actor itself (no-where else !!!)

* Understood language between actors 

* Process = recipes of a cook, NOT IN A DB

## Actor based IT solutions 

In order to simplify common IT architectures we should look at a   new way of creating such a system that does take the current standards into account:

* No people involved in integrating different components into a single solution

    * Which as a consequence means no revenue generation based on creating and managing complexity.

* No central state / operational data storage

* Individual automated actors with specific knowledge for specific tasks

* Independent operating actors completing specific tasks

Such a system should ideally be owned by many (not just a single organization, bring centralization back into the equations) which operate IT tasks for many.  We have not seen such a system in existence but we are as [ThreeFold Tech](threefold__threefold_tech) building and rolling out technology that is able to do this.

We believe that the future of IT is in decentralization where specific coordinators (bots) will roam a network of capacity looking for a task to do, making themselves available where needed, creating more of them if the system grows and allowing the global population to deploy and operate IT workloads.
