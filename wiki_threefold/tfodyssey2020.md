![](threefold__tfodyssey.jpg  )

This weekend, ThreeFold will be involved in [Odyssey Momentum 2020](https://www.odyssey.org/momentum/) – Momentum is an online event of 49 hours with more than 2,000 participants and 105 teams working on 21 complex 21st-century problems.

ThreeFold is [one of the platforms](https://gitlab.com/digicampus/ssi/ssi-overview) which can be used by participants, and we also have a ThreeFold team member there as a "jedi," who will be supporting participants in developing their solutions.

May the force be with all participants this weekend! 🙏
