# DigitalTwin Browser

![](threefold__jimber_browser.png  )

_The [Digital Twin](threefold__digitaltwin) Browser_ is a browser that runs close to your digital twin - [Crystal Twin](threefold__crystaltwin). It presents you with the ability to have a browser on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) running anywhere you want and to securely stream the content back to your local browser.

### Purpose

A lot of hacking happens in your current browser, but this won't be possible with a [Digital Twin](threefold__digitaltwin) browser. Millions of people are looking for a browser solution which is:

- neutral
- allows you to own all your data
- faster, simple to use
- cost-effective
- able to work everywhere
- has advanced features like real time collaboration

### Status Today
