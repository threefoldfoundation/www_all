# The Cloud Production Rate (CPR)

The Cloud Production Rate ([CPR](threefold__cloud_production_rate)) indicates how ‘productive’ a compute or server hardware platform is. The higher the [CPR](threefold__cloud_production_rate), the more capacity in form of compute and storage is added.
This makes it simple for a non-tech farmer to select the best farming hardware for the budget available. It is similar to the hashrate of a Bitcoin miner for example.

To calculate the [CPR](threefold__cloud_production_rate) are very simple and straightforward formula is used:

**CPR = 1.5 \* the amount of Compute Units (CU) of the hardware + the amount of Storage Units (SU) of the hardware**

How CU and SU are composed and calculated can be found [here](threefold__cloud_units.md)
