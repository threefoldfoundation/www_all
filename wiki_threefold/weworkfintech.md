# May 6: ThreeFold Demo's For WeWork FinTech Community

Good visibility for ThreeFold with new & focused audiences!

WeWork Fintech Labs is a vivid community of 3,500 members of startups that share our enthusiasm for decentralization. We are very happy for the opportunity to provide this community with an introduction to the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) and the recently launched [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) Cloud.

For that we were invited to a web-session by WeWork that was hosted last night, which will also be shared online with their community.
