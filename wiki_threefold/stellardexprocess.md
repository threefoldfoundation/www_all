Buying [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) through [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) is a bit more of an involved process than the other two options but it shouldn't be too difficult. We've broken it down into two main steps:

### Step One: Use an Exchange to Buy XLM with Fiat

*Note: If you already have XLM, you can skip down to Step Two.*

Fiat is the name for euros, dollars, or other government-issued currencies. A fiat gateway allows you to enter the world of digital currencies through depositing fiat currency.

- Liquid has a fiat gateway, so that is a good option. You can find more [here](threefold__tft_liquid.md).
- If you cannot use Liquid (e.g. country restriction), feel free to use one of the [exchanges recommended by Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/exchanges)

Next, you'll want to add funds to your wallet and exchange those funds for XLM. Those XLM can later be exchanged for [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) on the decentralized exchange.

- Each exchange will have its own options for depositing fiat. Note that credit card payments typically come with a higher fee but tend to be quicker to go through, whereas a bank transfer may take a couple of days but comes with a lower fee or sometimes none at all.
- Each of these exchanges will have instructions & an FAQ to help you with this process.

### Step Two: Convert XLM to TFT

This part of the process involves:
1. installing a new wallet that can be used to store XLM and buy [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)
2. setting up a trustline for [TFT](threefold__threefold_token), and
3. exchanging XLM for [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)
