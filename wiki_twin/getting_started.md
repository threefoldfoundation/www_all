### Full Integration
There is a full integration between all components. A chat application, File Storage, forum and video meetings. They will all work in the same manner and integrate into a single platform. Full usability and full ownership of all your data and communication.

Experiences:
- [Chat](threefold__chat.md)
- [filestorage](twin__filestorage.md)
- [Meet](twin__meet.md)
- [Office](twin__office.md)
- [Wallet](twin__wallet.md)

Imagine chatting with someone, in the chat you allow access to a file and collaborate on the file. After consideration a deep dive is needed so you just click the video button and have full live interaction.

Share your thoughts, share your files and share you mind.
