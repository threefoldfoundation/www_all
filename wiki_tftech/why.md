##  The World Needs Decentralization

The demand for true decentralization in the data economy is upon us. It is manifesting in two ways: decentralization of the digital infrastructure in terms of ownership and locality / distribution and the decentralization of information in terms of ownership and privacy of information.

### Decentralization of infrastructure

In order to serve emerging digital workloads such as edge computing, IOT, 5G, AI, swarm learning, VR, autonomous transport, blockchain, and more, the world is in need of scalable, ultra-secure, and decentralized digital capacity everywhere, on demand.

Today, more than 80% of the Internet's capacity is owned by centralized cloud providers. The capacity is derived from hyper-scale data centers - an infrastructure that is incredibly costly, therefore not scalable, while being super unstustainable. As of today the internet consumes about 10% of global energy resources.

### Decentralization of information

Digital Citizens, governments, policy makers, smart cities, indigenous tribes and municipalities are all demanding data ownership. The ability to provide data ownership to all parties involved while maintaining full regulatory requirements as well as security, scale & privacy is really important.

The annual volume of global data is growing at an exponential pace; and will reach 175 zettabytes by 2025. Processing of data will move to the edge, from 20% in 2018 to about 80% in 2025 with emerging technologies such as Edge Computing, IOT, 5G, AI, swarm learning, VR, Autonomous Transport, Blockchain etc. The demand for decentralization is already here.

There is also a growing global awareness of the value of our data in the data economy and that ownership, privacy and sovereignty shouldn't be negotiable. Great documentaries such as The Great Hack, Social Dilemma, The Creepy Line have gone viral in recent times, sharing about the need for decentralization and dangers of the current architecture. 

In 2020, Covid-19 also amplified the need for the Internet and made us realize a new normal where we spend much more time interacting with technology. It is incredibly important that we find a better alternative to centralized cloud providers that brings more privacy and security to data. For example, track & trace applications struggle to balance the respect of privacy with the need for information. 

But this can change quite rapidly if we adopt a better architecture and model based on new principles. 

### Core values

Our technology intends to promote SOVEREIGNTY, EQUALITY, SUSTAINABILITY whilst meeting this demand for decentralisation:
- __SOVEREIGNTY__: 
A decentralized data economy has to be __democratized, neutral__ and __secure__ to provide sovereignty to all stakeholders and their data. __Everyone__ shall be digitally sovereign and __own their data__ just like they would own any other assets.
- __EQUALITY__: 
A decentralised data economy needs to be __peer-to-peer, available everywhere__ and __owned by everyone__ – across geographical and cultural borders. Everyone (the
“bankable” and the “non-bankable”) deserves __equal chances__ to learn, partake and succeed in the __data economy__ (also remotest areas of our planet, as currently half of the world population still doesn`t have access to internet).
- __SUSTAINABILITY__: 
A decentralised data economy has to be environmentally conscious. All network, hardware and software components that constitute the digital infrastructure are optimized around energy-efficiency and carbon neutrality.


### Our philosophy: The Curve of Life

Professor and currency expert [Bernard Lietaer](http://www.lietaer.com/) advocated an upgrade of our money systems as a systemic solution to our global economic, financial, and sustainability crisis.

One of the ideas he advocated is how every system in the world balances between efficiency and resilience. In nature, resilience is several times more important than efficiency.

Understanding parts of his work helps to explain how the world became what it is today. It's the result of a period where efficiency was everything. It gave us the fastest evolution ever achieved in only 100 years, but it's not sustainable. His findings can be applied to anything: nature, money, technology, society, and more.

A super efficient system like a monoculture (such as a pine forest) will be not very resilient. These types of forests are very susceptible to sickness and fire, while on the other hand, a mixed forest of trees is much more resilient, but not so efficient. New systems which live in the windown of viability are required for money and Internet. 

Learn more about how to turn monocultures into monetary ecosystems, explained by Bernard himself [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGk-mXVSq6k). This is super relevant to current times. 

### The ThreeFold decentralized “Internet” & “IT” system is sustainable

Everything is a balance between efficiency and resilience (see above). In our current society, the focus is too much on efficiency which has lead to too centralized systems. Centralized systems are too fragile (boom-bust cycles) and can lead to abuse as well (we became a product of centralized data management systems e.g. Facebook). 

Current Internet systems are efficient (controlled) centralized systems, they can be hacked easily (are hacked) and are not private. They are positioned left on this curve. On the curve of life you would find the current Internet at the left side.

A new system is needed with the right balance between centralization and distribution; this is the true form of decentralization. We believe the right form is like a circle where we (or any legal entity) are the “center” of the decentralized world. Blockchain technology is used inside your center of the circle (which we call a digital avatar) as well as finding consensus in between the circles (digital avatars). The combination of both concepts makes a sustainable, viable solution possible. That solution would sit in the sustainable part of the curve of life. 

And that's what we've created. ThreeFold Tech’s technology can enable a peer-to-peer Internet to become reality with it's autonomous technology. An Internet owned by the users. All the technology of this new Internet is open-source and the whole experience is built around the fundamentals of a peer-to-peer network. This system enables us to move away from pyramids (centralized systems) to an Internet that empowers every user with their own cloud (without any intermediaries).
