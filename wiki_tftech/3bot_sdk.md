# 3Bot Software Development Kit (SDK)

The [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) Software Development Kit present a platform for developers and systems integrators to create and deploy the IT applications and services on the ThreeFold grid.  The SDK is a total end-to-end development platform to create solutions on the TF Grid and can run on the grid (or on a local server).  It uses the [Jumpscale framework](https://github.com/threefoldtech/js-ng)

The [3Bot](threefold__[3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)_def) = your virtual system administrator has been created using this SDK, if you go to your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) you have access to the SDK.
### Jumpscale: The automation platform which makes the 3Bot possible

Jumpscale is an automation framework written in Python. It has been developed for more than a decade and originates from an automation product that was acquired by SUN Microsystems from Q-Layer, which was one of our previous companies. Our newest release is version 11, called JS-NG.

Jumpscale is the foundation of the autonomous layer. To get to autonomous operations, IT experts have to model IT architectures. These models have to describe all the components involved in creating the architecture (e.g. a container running a web server, a container running a database server, and then all the required network paths between these two containers and the rest of the world). Once this description is complete and tested, it can be given to the autonomous layer which launches, monitors, and operates the architecture. Hence, autonomous IT.
