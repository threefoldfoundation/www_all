#### Integration with threefold connect (new)

Threefold Connect Delivers:

- strong authenticated DID system (DID = Digital ID sytem)
- integrated network client for the Planetary LAN 
- clients available for OSX, Linux, Windows, Android/IPhone (v2.5)
- wallet for [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) but in future for more digital currencies.
    
#### Planetary LAN (new)

- end2end encryption between users of an app and the app running behind the network wall.
- Each user end network point = strongly authenticated & uniquely identified independent of network carrier used.
- no need for centralized firewall or vpn solutions, the planetary lan allows for circle based networking security
- when a physical network path fails, the planetary LAN will look for other paths, it can even send your network packets over other planetary LAN nodes untill the destination is being reached.

#### Planetary DNS (v2.5)

- secure name services linked to the DID system(blockchain decentralized id system)
- requires each user to use ThreeFold Connect.
- The Planetary DNS system allows us to have a new naming system in place which scales and provides us with more flexibility.

## Specials

#### Based on Zero-OS = a stateless operating system as host
    
- no install, no upgrades
- no shell or server interface leads to more security

#### Secure boot & integration with silicon route of trust (HPE)

- the most secure way how to boot a server with hardware support 0-OS supports images which has secure boot enabled, ensuring 100% that what is booted uses an authentic image. 
- We can check on the software level that this is enabled, and create images which can only boot when full validation of authenticity happened. 

#### Hardware based network virtualization 

- based on pensando, the most secure networking and firewalling layer
    
#### FPGA based network switch (optional and OEM only)

- nano second latency to network your applications 
- ability to not use tcp-ip, basically switch application data natively on the switch level
