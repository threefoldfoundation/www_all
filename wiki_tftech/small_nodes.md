# Small Nodes (SoHo Nodes)

All Small / Soho Nodes (Small Office Home Office) come in a plug an farm manner as they come totally pre-assembled with the farmers details already linked to the device. All they have to do is provide it with a source of power and internet connection and the node does the rest. 
The devices are shipped by different entities throughout the world and orders for them are done through a pre-registration form you can find here:
[farmer.threefold.io](https://farmer.threefold.io). The nodes ship in batches of 50 to make sure both vendors and customers get the best prices available at that time. Keep this in mind when pre-registering.

# Certified Hardware

All Soho nodes are assembled by certified hardware vendors, which makes them eligible for Gold Certification.
To learn more please check out the [Farming Types & Certification](tftech__farming_types.md) section of this wiki.

# 10 x Reward In Some Areas
Just like all other farming equipment the small nodes are also capable of farming 10x as much tokens when put in certain areas.
These areas are: Africa and South America as capacity is very much needed here and not available to all yet, which is a core goal of ThreeFold: Making sure the whole world's population has access to the internet at a fair price.
