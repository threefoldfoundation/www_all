### consensus engine in reltion to minting in TFGrid 3.0


[Consensus Engine](threefold__consensus_engine) checks the following:

- if uptime + 99.5% per month then
  - formula [CPR](threefold__cloud_production_rate) * [CPR](threefold__cloud_production_rate) REWARD / [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) price -> [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) mined
    - CRP reward is prob 60 USD per [CPR](threefold__cloud_production_rate)
- required metadata per account is registered on the parity based [ThreeFold Chain](threefold__tfchain).
