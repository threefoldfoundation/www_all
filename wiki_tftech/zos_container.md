# ZOS Container

ThreeFold native container technology as implemented in [Zero-OS](threefold__zos).

Uses capacity layer from [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) and your virtual system administrator called [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) does the orchestration.

The [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) Container is not running in the Kubernetes part of the VDC, its running directly in the [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) ([Zero-OS](threefold__zos)) and can be integrated with the eVDC over the network.

## Features

*   import from docker (market std for containers)
*   integration with [zero-os overlay networking layer](tftech__vdc_network.md) (efficient, secure encrypted network between the containers)
*   can be easily deployed at the edge
*   integrated with scalable & capable monitoring system (prometheus based)
*   can be integrated with our advanced billing/charge back mechanism
*   Single-tenant!

## Main Benefits

### Reliable

*   [Hercules Protect](tftech__zos_protect.md): no hacking surface to the Zero-Nodes, integrate silicon route of trust
*   [Hercules P2P Network](tftech__vdc_network.md): encrypted overlay network connects the containers
*   [ZOS Filesystem ](zos_filesystem) (v2.x): dedupe, zero-install, hacker-proof for use in containers on kubernetes
*   [Hercules Web Gateway](tftech__web_gateway.md): intelligent connection between web (internet) and container services
*   [planetary network](tftech__planetary_network.md): a true global single backplane network connecting us all
