# Hercules Compliance


The [smart contract for IT provisioning methodology](tftech__smart_contract_for_it.md) allows for for transparency and autitability of deployed IT workloads.

### VDC Compute compliance

Deployed [ZOS Containers](tftech__zos_container.md) are end to end described in the blockchain database and inspectable.

### VDC Storage compliance

Deployed Hercules storage solutions and kubernetes cluster are end to end described in the blockchain database and inspectable.


For compliance purposes VDC Storage can be configured to have characteristics like:

- Immutability:  Write Once, Read Many-times (WORM)
- File versioning. Every update to a file leads to a new file version number.  Keep a number of (or all) older versions of the files to have complete traceability of what changed when, where and by whom.
- File activity logging.  Each and ever activity on files can be stored and made auditable to respective governance people, departments or authorities.


### VDC Networking
