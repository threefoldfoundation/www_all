# Competitive Overview.

To our knowledge, a truly decentralised and autonomous approach to delivering cloud capacity and a real solution for a sovereign digital life has not yet been achieved yet.

Traditionally cloud technology is centralized and very people intensive which adds to its complexity, risk and cost.  Blockchain is not scalable and private enough for that usecase.

## Are there approaches like us?

We have not found any project yet, which like us completely re-invented the way how computer, network and storage hardware is being used to deliver a true decentralized and sovereign cloud system which is good for the planet, person and country they live in.

This cloud system (capacity layer) is the basis to allow your digital avator to come alive and provide for a true decentralized independent digital life.

We re-invented / created:

- operating system (base capacity layer)
  - [Zero-OS](threefold__zos) = an operating system which is by design lighter, more secure and way more efficient
- storage / database layer
  - a true global scalable storage system which is 10x more efficient (Zero-STOR)
  - a global scalable database system which is upto 100x more efficient and has required blockchain features (BCDB)
- autonomous / sovereignity layer
  - our smart contract for IT layer provides consensus driven deployment of any IT workload
  - an autonomous agent called [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) which can be used as your virtual system administrator or as your backend for your digital life.
- identification and network layer 
  - planetary [Peer2Peer](threefold__peer2peer) overlay network
  - blockchain based decentralized ID system (DID), intgrated with the planetary network

There are other projects which put the person as the center of their digital life like holochain and solid, we believe these projects can perfectly live on top of our base layer technology as used in the grid. We don't see them as competition, rather as potential partners.

## Available market options for delivering cloud capacity

If you required cloud capacity for your project you can today choose between blockchain or centralized clouds, they both have their benefits and issues. We believe our approach of automomous IT resolves the possible issues found.

### Centralized Approach

Centralized Cloud (Hyperscale), represents the traditional centralised approach as we know it. 

Hyperscale data centres are typical examples of a fully centralized approach to cloud and demonstrate the shortcomings of such an approach. 

Issues with this approach:

- **unsustainable**
  - the internet already consumes as much as 10% of the world's power generation today. (source) power and network dependencies of centralized data centres is simply unsustainable. The extremely high cost to  entry and high levels of dependency on power and network infrastructure are major factors prohibiting the growth of digital infrastructure in emerging markets 
- **too centralized**
  - **ownership**
    - more than 80% of the cloud/internet infrastructure that exists today is owned by less than 20 organizations. This centralisation of power/ownership does not lend itself to equality in the data economy 
  - **locality**
    - the locality of the infrastructure itself is too centralised and not sufficiently distributed wrt: 
- **geographic coverage**
  - emerging markets are significantly under serviced in this regard 
edge presence: wrt distribution of digital infrastructure within the network itself. To the point above, the major trend of edge computing and the development of decentralised applications demands that the compute and storage infrastructure becomes far more distributed and located at the EDGE of the networks to service these new use cases (e.g. IOT, 5G, VR, AI etc)
- **costly**
  - The neto cost for providing the digital capacity needed to scale the internet economy is far too high and this results in a huge disparity in price across regions as well as many territories without service at all. This inequality and "digital divide" which prevents more than half the world's population to partake in the internet economy must be resolved
- **not secure enough**
  - The digital infrastructure of the internet economy today is built upon technology from major industry vendors with known back doors and are proven to be susceptible to breach in general. The attack vector on this technology is immense and has proven penetrable many times in the past. Our data in the hands of these technologies should not be considered safe by any means.

### Blockchain Approach

We like blockchain projects but they cannot be used in our opinion to create a new internet with.

Blockchain projects are great for smart contracts and as a store of value (digital currencies). 

Blockchain in general suffers from the Blockchain dilemma problem, which can be resolved by using our smart contract for IT layer.

|   | Public Blockchains  | Private Blockchains |
|---|---|---|
| Security  | Provided by having a large number of nodes running it  | Provided by having them in secure controlled places |
| People | Build, managed and controlled by unknown people | Build, managed and controlled by known people | 
| Speed | Slow by design - most data needs to be copied to all of them and consensus achieved | Fast(er) and  more efficient by design |

What is needed is scale & security, which cannot be achieved with current blockchain technologies.



## We are the missing layer for Blockchain and even Centralized Cloud

Many blockchain projects or centralized cloud solutions should see us as a missing layer for their use cases when decentralization, scaled security or sovereignity needs to be achieved.
