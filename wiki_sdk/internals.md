# Jumpscale 

Jumpscale: The automation platform that makes the [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) possible

Jumpscale is an automation framework written in Python. It has been developed for more than a decade and originates from an automation product that was acquired by SUN Microsystems from Q-Layer, which was one of our previous companies. Our newest release is js-ng (next generation).

Jumpscale is the foundation of the autonomous layer. To get to autonomous operations, IT experts have to model IT architectures. These models have to describe all the components involved in creating the architecture (e.g. a container running a webserver, a container running a database server, and then all the required network paths between these two containers and the rest of the world). Once this description is complete and tested, it could be given to the autonomous layer which launches, monitors, and operates the architecture. Hence, autonomous IT.

This is a section for jumpscale experts its under heavy construction and will have information how to work with Jumpscale in more detail.

Jumpscale is the framework used inside the TF Grid SDK.
