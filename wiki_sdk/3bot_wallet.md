### Your Wallet Details

- Name: is the name that you give to the wallet, and how it is shown in the admin panel
- Network: the [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) network (as the wallet can target the mainnet or testnet, which host also tokens that only work for the relevant network) 
- [Trustlines](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/assets.html) are specific to the [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) network to indicate that a user is 'trusting' the asset / crypto issuer, in our case trusting  ThreeFold Foundation as issuer of [TFT](threefold__threefold_token), [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)A, Free[TFT](threefold__threefold_token). 
Trustlines are specific to the network, so it needs to be established both on testnet and mainnet and for all the tokens that someone intends to hold. Without a trustline, a wallet address can't be fed with tokens. 
In order to make it easier for the user, trustlines are being established automatically when creating a wallet for [TFT](threefold__threefold_token), [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)A and Free[TFT](threefold__threefold_token) in the admin panel as well as in ThreeFold Connect app. However, if you use a third party [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) wallet for your tokens, you need to create the trustlines yourself.
