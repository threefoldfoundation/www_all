# Getting Started on TF Grid Testnet

![](sdk__get_started_testnet.png  )

## Get ThreeFold Connect App and 3Bot ID

As the first step, you need to get yourself a **ThreeFold Connect** and **[3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) ID**. This can be done by downloading the app on your smartphone and creating your own [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) Identity.

Please be aware that this ID will be used as your main digital identity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid) and holds the keys to access every service on the grid. Therefore, it's very important to remember the login data and the seed phrase of your ID. The ThreeFold Connect App will also provide you with an access to your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) Wallet where you can store your [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s.

## Get a 3Bot on Testnet

[**3Bot**](sdk__testnet_3bot.md) is your virtual system administrator.

> Easy Set Up (recommended): [Get a **Testnet Hosted 3Bot** using **3bot Deployer**](sdk__3bot_deployer.md) <BR>
> Advanced Set Up: [Create a **Testnet Local 3Bot** on your local machine](sdk__3bot_local_install.md)

## Launch and Log in to Your New Hosted 3Bot

Once youâ€™ve signed up and deployed a hosted [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) successfully, you will be given a link to access your hosted [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) via a web browser.

Go to the provided link to launch your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) and login to your new [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) admin dashboard by connecting it to your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) ID. You can use the ThreeFold Connect App on your mobile phone to verify your identity.

## Get Testnet TFT (Tokens for IT Capacity)

Once you're logged in to your [3Bot](threefold__[3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)_def) for the first time, a **pre-configured [3Bot](threefold__[3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)_def) Wallet** will be created for you on your hosted [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def), with an initial balance of **1000 [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) Testnet**.

> These [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s are not real [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s, they are only usable on Testnet.

These [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s can be used to reserve test IT Capacity on top of the TF Grid testnet.

You could also use **third-party testnet [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) wallets** to store your [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) on testnet.

You can also get [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) from our _testnet [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) faucet_ which is a hosted bot that creates your Testnet [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) to be used on testnet.
