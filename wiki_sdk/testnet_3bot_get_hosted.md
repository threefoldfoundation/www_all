# Getting a hosted 3Bot  on TF Grid Testnet


You can get a hosted [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) on testnet [here](https://deploy3bot.testnet.grid.tf). 
Browse to the website and log in using your ThreeFold Connect app. Please, make sure to have a [TFT funded stellar testnet wallet](sdk__testnet_wallet_interstellar.md), so you can extend the lifetime of your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) once deployed.

Once you're in, you can either `Deploy a new 3bot`, or you can view the hosted [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s that you have created before for recovery (`View my existing [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s`). All [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def)s are backed up, so recovery is possible. 

Select `Deploy a new 3Bot` and `Create`

And you're done ! 
Now your hosted [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) is available at the indicated url.
