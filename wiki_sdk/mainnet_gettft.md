- If you have had some experience with trading, buying and selling digital currencies:
    - We'd recommend you go through one of the digital currency exchanges if those are available in your country. 
    - Or use a [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) decentralized exchange.
- If you  have little to no experience with trading, buying and selling digital currencies:
    - We'd recommend you to purchase [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) directly from a TF Farmer.

_Keep in mind buying digital currencies through exchanges does involve some steps and time, but in the end this is because there is an exchange of money happening â€“ so security, verification of identity, and related procedures are quite important._
