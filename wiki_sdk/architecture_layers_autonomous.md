## Autonomous Layer

Imagine the autonomous layer as being the bridge between users and the capacity layer. The system is capable of self-driving and self-healing, therefore removing the human requirement for deploying and operating IT infrastructure and services, and vastly minimizing the possibility of hacking. 

The idea behind the autonomous layer is to make every individual digitally independent and enable a digital world inspired by nature. Just like no one would be able to access your face-to-face conversations or be aware of what you do in your everyday life as you only would know it, the autonomous later undertakes all the processes in the background for you to remain at the center of your digital life.
