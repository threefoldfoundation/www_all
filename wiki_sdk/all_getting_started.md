## Get ThreeFold Connect App and 3Bot ID

As the first step, you need to get yourself a **ThreeFold Connect** and **[3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) ID**. This could be done by downloading the app on your smartphone and create your own [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) Identity.

Please be aware that this ID is going to be used as your main digital identity on the [ThreeFold Grid](threefold__threefold_grid), and holds the keys to access every services on the grid. Therefore, it's very important to remember the login data and the seed phrase of your ID. The ThreeFold Connect App will also provide you with an access to your [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) Wallet where you could store your [TFT](threefold__threefold_token)s.

## Get and Store TFT to Reserve for Your IT Capacity

To reserve IT Capacity and pay for your workload on top of the TF Grid, you would need to purchase some [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) and store it on one of your wallets. To store your [TFT](threefold__threefold_token), you could use the **[3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) Wallet** on your ThreeFold Connect App, a **third-party [Stellar Blockchain](threefold__stellar_blockchain) wallet**, or the **pre-configured [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def) wallet** on your hosted [3Bot](threefold__3bot_def). To get more [TFT](threefold__threefold_token), you could **buy or trade other tokens** into [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) from one of the supporting exchangers, or purchase [TFT](threefold__threefold_token) directly from the farms.
